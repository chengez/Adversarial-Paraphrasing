This molecular mechanism may also regulate adhesion formation in patients following hepatectomy. HGF inhibited formation of adhesions by regulating IFN- and PAI-1, suggesting that it may be an important target for prevention of adhesions after hepatectomy. SURGICAL RELEVANCE: Postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions can be asymptomatic or cause significant morbidity and mortality. Adhesion formation after hepatectomy has not been studied extensively. In the present study, the molecular mechanisms underlying intra-abdominal adhesions after hepatectomy were investigated in a murine model and in patients. Interferon (IFN) produced by natural killer T cells is a key molecule for adhesion formation after hepatectomy in mice, acting via the reciprocal balance between plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) 1 and tissue plasminogen activator, the pivotal factors in fibrinolytic activity. This mechanism was also involved in the regulation of adhesions in human tissue samples. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) strongly inhibited adhesion formation by regulating IFN- and PAI-1. These results indicate that IFN- and PAI-1 are possible therapeutic targets, and HGF could prevent postoperative adhesion formation after hepatectomy.",

We therefore introduce the envisioned system concept, discuss its implementation, outline the high-level architecture, and identify major data flows, while also offering insights into the corresponding design and deployment aspects. Our conducted case study confirms the potential of the described crowd sourced vehicular system to effectively complement and eventually surpass even the best of today's static video surveillance setups.

Such models are usually considered \"black boxes,\" meaning that their predictions are not interpretable. Prior work on explainable models in MIR has generally used image processing tools to produce explanations for DNN predictions, but these are not necessarily musically meaningful, or can be listened to (which, arguably, is important in music). We propose audioLIME , a method based on Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME), extended by a musical definition of locality. LIME learns locally linear models on perturbations of an example that we want to explain. Instead of extracting components of the spectrogram using image segmentation as part of the LIME pipeline, we propose using source separation. The perturbations are created by switching onoff sources which makes our explanations listenable. We first validate audioLIME on a classifier that was deliberately trained to confuse the true target with a spurious signal, and show that this can easily be detected using our method. We then show that it passes a sanity check that many available explanation methods fail. Finally, we demonstrate the general applicability of our (model-agnostic) method on a third-party music tagger.",

This is a serious handicap for both the theory and practice of EBM.

We show that the model has a particularly simple form in the space of the latent variables of the flow-based model, and MCMC sampling of the EBM in the latent space, which is a simple special case of neural transport MCMC, mixes well and traverses modes in the data space.

Furthermore, the control design is performed considering aerodynamics and state information available in the commercial autopilots with the aim of an ease implementation. It is achieved that the closed-loop system is G.A.S. and robust to external disturbances. The difference among the available controllers in the literature is: 1) it depends on available states, hence it is not required extra sensors or observers; and 2) it is possible to achieve any desired airplane state with an ease of implementation, since its design is performed keeping in mind the capability of implementation in any commercial autopilot.",

Similar gene classes are also methylated in aphids and honeybees, suggesting either conservation or convergence of methylation patterns. In addition to this evidence of evolutionary stability, we also show that infection with the virulent wMelPop Wolbachia strain induces additional methylation and demethylation events in the genome. While most of these changes seem random with respect to gene function and have no detected effect on transcription, there does appear to be enrichment of genes associated with membrane function. Given that Wolbachia lives within a membrane-bound vacuole of host origin and retains a large number of genes for transporting host amino acids, inorganic ions and ATP despite a severely reduced genome, these changes might represent an evolved strategy for manipulating the host environments for its own gain. Testing for a direct link between these methylation changes and expression, however, will require study across a broader range of developmental stages and tissues with methods that detect splice variants.",

In this paper, we review the four approaches, propose several optimization heuristics, and perform comparative experimentation on four representative constructions that are considered the most efficient in each approach. The experimental results show that (1) the determinization-based Safra-Piterman construction outperforms the other three in producing smaller complements and finishing more tasks in the allocated time and (2) the proposed heuristics substantially improve the Safra-Piterman and the slice-based constructions.",

This is called a temperature inversion (since normally the reverse is true). This creates a \"duct\" of cool air near ground level. The boundary between the sudden rise in temperature has a high refractive index. The denser cooler air slows the wave a little more than the warmer air, making it curve downwards. When a radio wave enters the boundary between cold and warm, it reflects it back down to Earth. If it hits this boundary at a low angle, it can curve well beyond the horizon. So it's not really the rain that's causing it, but usually the front that brings in the storm. Rain can actually have the opposite effect at higher microwave frequencies.

In a separate strand of research data-assimilation has been successfully used to optimally combine forecast models and their inherent uncertainty with incoming noisy observations. The key idea in our work here is to achieve increased forecast capabilities by judiciously combining machine-learning algorithms and data assimilation. We combine the physics-agnostic data-driven approach of random feature maps as a forecast model within an ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation procedure. The machine-learning model is learned sequentially by incorporating incoming noisy observations. We show that the obtained forecast model has remarkably good forecast skill while being computationally cheap once trained. Going beyond the task of forecasting, we show that our method can be used to generate reliable ensembles for probabilistic forecasting as well as to learn effective model closure in multi-scale systems.",

We trained the model on manually segmented structural T1, T1ce, T2, and Flair MRI images of 335 patients with tumors of variable severity, size and location. We then tested the model using independent data of 125 patients and successfully segmented brain tumors into three subregions: the tumor core (TC), the enhancing tumor (ET) and the whole tumor (WT). We also explored several data augmentations and preprocessing steps to improve segmentation performance. Importantly, our model was implemented on a single NVIDIA GTX1060 graphics unit and hence optimizes tumor segmentation for widely affordable hardware.

In the two-step approach, one would first compute a regularized reconstruction of the unobservable signal, and then compute an estimate of its cross-power spectrum from the regularized solution. We investigate whether the optimal regularization parameter for reconstruction of the signal also gives the best estimate of the cross-power spectrum. We show that the answer depends on the regularization method, and specifically we prove that, under a white Gaussian assumption: (i) when regularizing with truncated SVD the optimal parameter is the same; (ii) when regularizing with the Tikhonov method, the optimal parameter for the cross-power spectrum is lower than half the optimal parameter for the signal. We also provide evidence that a one-step approach would likely have better mathematical properties of the two-step approach.

Initially, AI developed on a separate trajectory, both topically and institutionally, from pattern recognition, neural information processing, decision and control systems, and allied topics by focusing on symbolic systems within computer science departments rather than on continuous systems in electrical engineering departments. The separate evolutions continued throughout the author's lifetime, with some crossover in reinforcement learning and graphical models, but were shocked into converging by the virality of deep learning, thus making an electrical engineer into an AI researcher. Now that this convergence has happened, opportunity exists to pursue an agenda that combines learning and reasoning bridged by interpretable machine learning models.",

The dispute began after Fleming incorporated elements of an undeveloped film script written by McClory and screenwriter Jack Whittingham - including characters and plot points - into Thunderball, which McClory contested in court, claiming ownership over elements of the novel. In 1963, Fleming settled out of court with McClory, in an agreement which awarded McClory the film rights. This enabled him to become a producer for the 1965 film Thunderball - with Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman as executive producers - and the non-Eon film Never Say Never Again, an updated remake of Thunderball, in 1983.[N 3] A second remake, entitled Warhead 2000 A.D., was planned for production and release in the 1990s before being abandoned.

In this paper, we prove that this additional information enables the adversary to infer the membership of any number of datapoints with full accuracy in a single query, causing complete membership privacy breach. Our approach obviates any attack model training or access to side knowledge with the adversary. Moreover, our algorithms are agnostic to the model under attack and hence, enable perfect membership inference even for models that do not memorize or overfit.

Consistent with a growing body of evidence, our findings suggest that a complex form of balancing selection may alternatively explain the evolution and maintenance of AMSs in a colour polymorphic fish. In particular, this study demonstrates that intrasexual competition results in phenotypically distinct males exhibiting clear differences in their levels of aggression to exclude potential sexual rivals. By being dominant, the more aggressive males are able to circumvent female mating preferences for attractive males, whereas another male type incorporates subordinate behaviours that allow them to circumvent male aggression and female mating preferences. Together, these and previous results indicate that exploiting different aspects of social interactions may allow males to evolve distinct mating strategies and thus the long term maintenance of polymorphisms within populations.",

Conventional methods address such challenges by resorting to fixed multi-scale architectures that are often unable to cover the largely varied scales while ignoring the rotation variations. In this paper, we propose a unified neural network framework, named Deep Recurrent Spatial-Aware Network, which adaptively addresses the two issues in a learnable spatial transform module with a region-wise refinement process. Specifically, our framework incorporates a Recurrent Spatial-Aware Refinement (RSAR) module iteratively conducting two components: i) a Spatial Transformer Network that dynamically locates an attentional region from the crowd density map and transforms it to the suitable scale and rotation for optimal crowd estimation; ii) a Local Refinement Network that refines the density map of the attended region with residual learning. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks show the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, comparing with the existing best-performing methods, we achieve an improvement of 12 on the largest dataset WorldExpo'10 and 22.8 on the most challenging dataset UCFCC50.",

Our SEM-SpMM incorporates many in-memory optimizations for large power-law graphs.

Furthermore, on a single large parallel machine, our SEM-SpMM operates as fast as the distributed implementations of Trilinos using five times as much processing power. We also run our implementation in memory (IM-SpMM) to quantify the overhead of keeping data on SSDs. SEM-SpMM achieves almost 100 performance of IM-SpMM on graphs when the dense matrix has more than four columns; it achieves at least 65 performance of IM-SpMM on all inputs.

Basically, I fail to see the difference between pedophilia and homosexuality, or heterosexuality for that matter, besides the subject matter. A pedophile is simply someone who is attracted to children. The common view seems to be that pedophilia is a disorder in fact it's classified as a psychiatric disorder, rather than an orientation or a paraphilia. I think this seems unfair there are likely thousands, if not millions of good citizens of the world who are struggling to get by as closet pedophiles, deemed to have a disorder by the doctors of the world. Surely a pedophile who has no inclination or possibility of molesting or abusing a child is just as functional in society as a homosexual, if not a heterosexual? Why then is pedophilia, the paraphilia itself, touted as a disorder, and pedophiles thought of as needing theraphy, or treatment, for their \"condition\"?",

This decay is partly attributed to oversmoothing, where repeated graph convolutions eventually make node embeddings indistinguishable. We take a closer look at two different interpretations, aiming to quantify oversmoothing. Our main contribution is PairNorm , a novel normalization layer that is based on a careful analysis of the graph convolution operator, which prevents all node embeddings from becoming too similar. What is more, PairNorm is fast, easy to implement without any change to network architecture nor any additional parameters, and is broadly applicable to any GNN. Experiments on real-world graphs demonstrate that PairNorm makes deeper GCN, GAT, and SGC models more robust against oversmoothing, and significantly boosts performance for a new problem setting that benefits from deeper GNNs.

Divorceseparation would be more clear cut as well. Those who wish to adorn their relationship as marriages can do so through whatever institution they want. Having said that, I'm interested in knowing if there are any compelling reasons to keep marriage legally sanctioned in the US?

Our lower bounds grow more slowly with data set size than existing work that trains the hidden layer weights. Second, we show that kernels typically associated with the ReLU activation function have fundamental flaws - there are simple data sets where it is impossible for widely studied bias-free models to achieve zero training loss irrespective of how the parameters are chosen or trained. Lastly, our analysis of gradient descent clearly illustrates how spectral properties of certain matrices impact both the early iteration and long-term training behavior. We propose new activation functions that avoid the pitfalls of ReLU in that they admit zero training loss solutions for any set of distinct data points and experimentally exhibit favorable spectral properties.",

However, current algorithms focus either on finding overlapping or non-overlapping communities. We present a generalized framework that can identify both non-overlapping and overlapping communities, without any prior input about the network or its community distribution. To do so, we introduce a vertex-based metric, GenPerm , that quantifies by how much a vertex belongs to each of its constituent communities. Our community detection algorithm is based on maximizing the GenPerm over all the vertices in the network. We demonstrate, through experiments over synthetic and real-world networks, that GenPerm is more effective than other metrics in evaluating community structure. Further, we show that due to its vertex-centric property, GenPerm can be used to unfold several inferences beyond community detection, such as core-periphery analysis and message spreading. Our algorithm for maximizing GenPerm outperforms six state-of-the-art algorithms in accurately predicting the ground-truth labels. Finally, we discuss the problem of resolution limit in overlapping communities and demonstrate that maximizing GenPerm can mitigate this problem.",

They can also be useful for large problems, where the generally tighter polymatroidal bound is computationally impractical. We then extend these new bounds to the multi-server index coding problem.

To answer this question, we evaluate thirteen popular password managers and consider all three stages of the password manager lifecycle - password generation, storage, and autofill. Our evaluation is the first analysis of password generation in password managers, finding several non-random character distributions and identifying instances where generated passwords were vulnerable to online and offline guessing attacks.

Despite being almost visually identical to the clean data, the adversarial images can fool deep neural networks into wrong predictions with very high confidence. In this paper, however, we show that we can build a simple binary classifier separating the adversarial apart from the clean data with accuracy over 99. We also empirically show that the binary classifier is robust to a second-round adversarial attack. In other words, it is difficult to disguise adversarial samples to bypass the binary classifier. Further more, we empirically investigate the generalization limitation which lingers on all current defensive methods, including the binary classifier approach. And we hypothesize that this is the result of intrinsic property of adversarial crafting algorithms.",

Expression of Neuroglian in sensory neurons alone is sufficient to promote axon advance and the intracellular region of the molecule is largely dispensable for this function. It is unlikely, therefore, that Nrg acts as a molecular 'clutch' to couple adhesion of F-actin within the growth cone to the extracellular substrate. Rather, we suggest that Neuroglian mediates sensory axon advance by promoting adhesion of the surface of the growth cone to its substrate. Our finding that stalling of a pioneer sensory neuron is rescued by driving Neuroglian in sensory neurons alone may suggest that Neuroglian can act in a heterophilic fashion.",

Getting the requirements correct at the very beginning of the lifecycle is crucial for the success of engineering a correct system. This is especially the case for safety-critical complex systems, where incorrect or clashing requirements can lead to accidents. While there is a large volume of work on the formal verification for the bottom-up composition of requirements, there are very few works on how these requirements are rigorously decomposed top-down in the first place. This paper tackles this problem. Inspired by Contract-Based Design, we develop a formalism for requirement decomposition, which can mathematically guarantee a satisfactory system implementation if certain conditions are respected. A systematic methodology is then designed to semi-automatically search for the optimal sub-requirements and guarantee their correctness upon definition. The proposed approach is supported by existing formal methods (i.e., Reachability Analysis and Constraint Programming) that have been applied to other areas. Finally, we support our findings through a case study on a cruise control system to illustrate the usability of the proposed approach.",

In particular, we posit that this open source fingerprint reader will facilitate the exploration of novel fingerprint spoof detection techniques involving both hardware and software. We demonstrate one such spoof detection technique by specially customizing RaspiReader with two cameras for fingerprint image acquisition. One camera provides high contrast, frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) fingerprint images, and the other outputs direct images of the finger in contact with the platen. Using both of these image streams, we extract complementary information which, when fused together and used for spoof detection, results in marked performance improvement over previous methods relying only on grayscale FTIR images provided by COTS optical readers. Finally, fingerprint matching experiments between images acquired from the FTIR output of RaspiReader and images acquired from a COTS reader verify the interoperability of the RaspiReader with existing COTS optical readers.",

When inattention to the temporal side is manifest on monocular visual testing it should raise the suspicion of chiasmal pathology.",

We present PersGNN - an end-to-end trainable deep learning model that combines graph representation learning with topological data analysis to capture a complex set of both local and global structural features. While variations of these techniques have been successfully applied to proteins before, we demonstrate that our hybridized approach, PersGNN, outperforms either method on its own as well as a baseline neural network that learns from the same information. PersGNN achieves a 9.3 boost in area under the precision recall curve (AUPR) compared to the best individual model, as well as high F1 scores across different gene ontology categories, indicating the transferability of this approach.",

We show that node classification according to degree distributions or geodesic distances cannot faithfully capture node ranking in terms of certainty. Instead, all possible paths connecting each unit with the rest in the network must be incorporated.

However, existing methods do not specifically pre-train reasonable embeddings for targets and aspects in TABSA. This may result in targets or aspects having the same vector representations in different contexts and losing the context-dependent information. To address this problem, we propose a novel method to refine the embeddings of targets and aspects. Such pivotal embedding refinement utilizes a sparse coefficient vector to adjust the embeddings of target and aspect from the context. Hence the embeddings of targets and aspects can be refined from the highly correlative words instead of using context-independent or randomly initialized vectors. Experiment results on two benchmark datasets show that our approach yields the state-of-the-art performance in TABSA task.",

However, the observation that brooding females and females 24 hours FOR did not catch prey within the trial period indicates that maternal care significantly reduces predatory efficiency in these scorpions. Females 28 days FOR were still not as efficient at catching prey as non-gravid and gravid females, suggesting that reproductive costs extend for at least 4 weeks after the end of the maternal care period. Preferential use of an active foraging strategy by brooding females may increase prey encounter rates, allowing the scorpions to more rapidly replenish energy reserves depleted during reproduction. However, active foraging may be energetically costly and increase predation risk for brooding females.

The features are computed by applying deep convolutional nets to image patches that are located and normalized by the pose. We perform an empirical study of a number of pose normalization schemes, including an investigation of higher order geometric warping functions. We propose a novel graph-based clustering algorithm for learning a compact pose normalization space. We perform a detailed investigation of state-of-the-art deep convolutional feature implementations and fine-tuning feature learning for fine-grained classification. We observe that a model that integrates lower-level feature layers with pose-normalized extraction routines and higher-level feature layers with unaligned image features works best. Our experiments advance state-of-the-art performance on bird species recognition, with a large improvement of correct classification rates over previous methods (75 vs. 55-65).",

By connecting the feature extraction and learning processes rather than treating them as disparate plugins, we show that HOG features can be viewed as doing two things: (i) inducing capacity in, and (ii) adding prior to a linear SVM trained on pixels. From this perspective, preserving second-order statistics and locality of interactions are key to good performance.

They use a familiar word or phrase, but in a surprising way that our brain finds funny. There is also a meta aspect to the pun humor. Puns work by twisting sounds in ways that don't always perfectly match, but they are close enough that our brains figure out how to make the connection. We enjoy solving that problem, and those who love puns love solving that challenge. The more challenging, the better. Those who hate puns do so (I'm guessing) because they get annoyed at this twisting of language. Plus the punchline is unlike other types of jokes. Instead of taking the brain to a new direction, the brain is being asked to simply make a word connection. It's intellectual humor, but some people prefer pratfall humor.",

An attractive solution is to move the feeder link to the higher QV band, where more spectrum is available. When utilizing the QV band, due to heavy rain attenuation, gateway diversity is considered a necessity to ensure the required feeder link availability. Although receive site diversity has been studied in the past for SatCom, there is much less maturity in terms of transmit diversity techniques. In this paper, a modified switch and stay combining scheme is proposed for a QV band feeder link, but its performance is also evaluated over an end-to-end satellite link.

The palifermin-treated donor mice alone showed a similar Th2 cytokine profile, and we observed elevated levels of thymic stromal lymphopoietin mRNA in the thymus. We further demonstrated that treating the donor mice with palifermin protects against GVHD-associated morbidity, even if the donors are deficient in Valpha14i natural killer T cells. Our findings clearly show that palifermin mediates immunoregulatory effects in addition to its cytoprotective effects and that both are likely to be involved in the mechanism through which palifermin provides protection from acute murine GVHD.",

While lamps have traditionally been rated and marketed primarily in terms of their power consumption, expressed in watts, proliferation of lighting technology beyond the incandescent light bulb has eliminated the correspondence of wattage to the amount of light produced. For example, a 60 W incandescent light bulb produces about the same amount of light as a 13 W compact fluorescent lamp. Each of these technologies has a different efficacy in converting electrical energy to visible light. Visible light output is typically measured in lumens. This unit only quantifies the visible radiation, and excludes invisible infrared and ultraviolet light. A wax candle produces on the close order of 13 lumens, a 60 watt incandescent lamp makes around 700 lumens, and a 15-watt compact fluorescent lamp produces about 800 lumens, but actual output varies by specific design.

Yet, our understanding of the factors influencing a relocation decision is very limited. In this paper we investigate how the scientific profile of a scientist determines their decision to move (i.e., change institution). To this aim, we describe a scientist's profile by three main aspects: the scientist's recent scientific career, the quality of their scientific environment and the structure of their scientific collaboration network. We then design and implement a two-stage predictive model: first, we use data mining to predict which researcher will move in the next year on the basis of their scientific profile; second we predict which institution they will choose by using a novel social-gravity model, an adaptation of the traditional gravity model of human mobility. Experiments on a massive dataset of scientific publications show that our approach performs well in both the stages, resulting in a 85 reduction of the prediction error with respect to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

Another of Eisenhower's concerns was the possibility of a wider war with the Soviet Union after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side.

One method of adding charging stations is to install them at parking spots. While there are costs to constructing spots with chargers and they preclude regular internal combustion engine (ICE) drivers from using these spots, EV drivers may have a higher valuation for these spots due to their parking and charging demand. We look at two models for how decisions surrounding investment in charging stations on existing parking spots may be undertaken. First, we analyze two firms who compete over installing stations under government set mandates or subsidies. Given the cost of constructing spots and the competitiveness of markets, we find it is ambiguous whether setting higher mandates or higher subsidies for spot construction leads to better aggregate outcomes. Second, we look at a system operator who faces uncertainty on the size of the EV market. If they are risk neutral, we find a relatively small change in the uncertainty of the EV market can lead to large changes in the optimal charging capacity.",

Further, they are quantitatively accurate models of temporally-averaged responses of neurons in the primate brain's visual system. However, biological visual systems have two ubiquitous architectural features not shared with typical CNNs: local recurrence within cortical areas, and long-range feedback from downstream areas to upstream areas. Here we explored the role of recurrence in improving classification performance. We found that standard forms of recurrence (vanilla RNNs and LSTMs) do not perform well within deep CNNs on the ImageNet task. In contrast, novel cells that incorporated two structural features, bypassing and gating, were able to boost task accuracy substantially. We extended these design principles in an automated search over thousands of model architectures, which identified novel local recurrent cells and long-range feedback connections useful for object recognition. Moreover, these task-optimized ConvRNNs matched the dynamics of neural activity in the primate visual system better than feedforward networks, suggesting a role for the brain's recurrent connections in performing difficult visual behaviors.",

Moreover, varying numbers of H-bonds and their strengths control the likelihood for energetic fluctuations as H-bonds break and reform, thus directly affecting thermodynamic properties. Consequently, these results demonstrate how unexpected large differences, especially within cooperativity correlation, emerge from subtle differences within the underlying H-bond network. This inference is consistent with well-known results that show allosteric response within a family generally varies significantly.

The problem of multi-target tracking aims to assign noisy detections to a-priori unknown and time-varying number of tracked objects across a sequence of frames. A majority of the existing solutions focus on either tediously designing cost functions or formulating the task of data association as a complex optimization problem that can be solved effectively. Instead, we exploit the power of deep learning to formulate the data association problem as inference in a CNN. To this end, we propose to learn a similarity function that combines cues from both image and spatial features of objects.

In this work, we carried out a design study to assess the effectiveness of applying Vivado-HLS in structural design. We employed Vivado-HLS to synthesize C functions corresponding to standalone network-on-chip (NoC) routers as well as complete multi-endpoint NoCs. Interestingly, we find that describing a complete NoC comprising router submodules faces fundamental difficulties not present in describing the routers as standalone modules. Ultimately, we succeeded in using Vivado-HLS to produce router and NoC modules that are exact cycle- and bit-accurate replacements of our reference RTL-based router and NoC modules. Furthermore, the routers and NoCs resulting from HLS and RTL are comparable in resource utilization and critical path delay. Our experience subjectively suggests that HLS is able to simplify the design effort even though much of the structural details had to be provided in the HLS description through a combination of coding discipline and explicit pragmas.

To address these problems, we give a detailed analysis of the reasons behind the inaccurate entity extraction problem, and then propose a simple but extremely effective model structure to solve this problem.

We study the classical principal-agent problem in a setting where the agent can be of one of several types (affecting the outcome of actions they might take). This combines the contract theory phenomena of \"moral hazard\" (incomplete information about actions) with that of \"adverse selection\" (incomplete information about types). We examine this problem through the computational lens. We show that in this setting it is APX-hard to compute either the profit-maximizing single contract or the profit-maximizing menu of contracts (as opposed to in the absence of types, where one can efficiently compute the optimal contract). We then show that the performance of the best linear contract scales especially well in the number of types: if agent has n available actions and T possible types, the best linear contract achieves an O ( n log T) approximation of the best possible profit. Finally, we apply our framework to prove tight worst-case approximation bounds between a variety of benchmarks of mechanisms for the principal.",

Many person re-ID models typically employ semantic cues such as body parts or human pose to improve the re-ID performance. Attribute information, however, is often not utilized. The proposed AANet leverages on a baseline model that uses body parts and integrates the key attribute information in an unified learning framework. The AANet consists of a global person ID task, a part detection task and a crucial attribute detection task. By estimating the class responses of individual attributes and combining them to form the attribute attention map (AAM), a very strong discriminatory representation is constructed. The proposed AANet outperforms the best state-of-the-art method using ResNet-50 by 3.36 in mAP and 3.12 in Rank-1 accuracy on DukeMTMC-reID dataset. On Market1501 dataset, AANet achieves 92.38 mAP and 95.10 Rank-1 accuracy with re-ranking, outperforming , another state of the art method using ResNet-152, by 1.42 in mAP and 0.47 in Rank-1 accuracy.

By allowing the dynamic adjustment of cell-specific ULDL configuration, D-TDD flexibly allocates percentage of subframes to UL and DL transmissions to accommodate the traffic within each cell. However, the unaligned transmissions bring in extra interference which degrades the potential gain achieved by D-TDD. In this work, we propose an analytical framework to study the performance of multi-antenna small cell networks with clustered D-TDD, where cell clustering is employed to mitigate the interference from opposite transmission direction in neighboring cells. With tools from stochastic geometry, we derive explicit expressions and tractable tight upper bounds for success probability and network throughput. The proposed analytical framework allows to quantify the effect of key system parameters, such as ULDL configuration, cluster size, antenna number, and SINR threshold. Our results show the superiority of the clustered D-TDD over the traditional D-TDD, and reveal the fact that there exists an optimal cluster size for DL performance, while UL performance always benefits from a larger cluster.",

Our point-wise learning architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder directly takes points (a point and its neighbors) as input, and learns a latent representation vector which is gone through the decoder and related to the ground-truth position. Our trained network can automatically infer a corresponding quality point set to a noisy point cloud input.

In principle, these behaviors can include vigor, defence or even risk-averseness. These are some examples of what we refer to in the broader context as Situational Awareness (SA). We incorporate SA, in the form of vigor , into hierarchical RL by defining and learning situationally aware options in a Probabilistic Goal Semi-Markov Decision Process (PG-SMDP). This is achieved using our Situationally Aware oPtions (SAP) policy gradient algorithm which comes with a theoretical convergence guarantee. We learn reusable options in different scenarios in a RoboCup soccer domain (i.e., winninglosing). These options learn to execute with different levels of vigor resulting in human-like behaviours such as 'time-wasting' in the winning scenario. We show the potential of the agent to exit bad local optima using reusable options in RoboCup.

Weakly-supervised learning can train models by relying on weaker forms of annotation, such as scribbles. Here, we learn to segment using scribble annotations in an adversarial game. With unpaired segmentation masks, we train a multi-scale GAN to generate realistic segmentation masks at multiple resolutions, while we use scribbles to learn the correct position in the image. Central to the model's success is a novel attention gating mechanism, which we condition with adversarial signals to act as a shape prior, resulting in better object localization at multiple scales. We evaluated our model on several medical (ACDC, LVSC, CHAOS) and non-medical (PPSS) datasets, and we report performance levels matching those achieved by models trained with fully annotated segmentation masks. We also demonstrate extensions in a variety of settings: semi-supervised learning; combining multiple scribble sources (a crowdsourcing scenario) and multi-task learning (combining scribble and mask supervision).

Fairness is typically defined by asking that some statistic of a classifier be approximately equal over protected groups within a population. In this paper, current approaches to fairness are discussed and used to motivate algorithmic proposals that incorporate fairness into genetic programming for classification. We propose two ideas. The first is to incorporate a fairness objective into multi-objective optimization. The second is to adapt lexicase selection to define cases dynamically over intersections of protected groups. We describe why lexicase selection is well suited to pressure models to perform well across the potentially infinitely many subgroups over which fairness is desired. We use a recent genetic programming approach to construct models on four datasets for which fairness constraints are necessary, and empirically compare performance to prior methods utilizing game-theoretic solutions. Methods are assessed based on their ability to generate trade-offs of subgroup fairness and accuracy that are Pareto optimal. The result show that genetic programming methods in general, and random search in particular, are well suited to this task.",

This paper also introduces a novel proof technique based on the perturbable gradient basis (PGB) necessary condition of local minima, which provides new insight into the elimination of local minima and is applicable to analyze various models and transformations of objective functions beyond the elimination of local minima.",

In principle this can always be done with a transformer, however the turns ratio of a transformer is not adjustable. A general matching network with at least two adjustments can be made to correct both components of impedance. Matching networks using discrete inductors and capacitors will have losses associated with those components, and will have power restrictions when used for transmitting. Avoiding these difficulties, commercial antennas are generally designed with fixed matching elements or feeding strategies to get an approximate match to standard coax, such as 50 or 75 Ohms. Antennas based on the dipole (rather than vertical antennas) should include a balun in between the transmission line and antenna element, which may be integrated into any such matching network.",

In these classification settings, group fairness criteria such as independence, separation and sufficiency can be measured directly by comparing rates of outcomes between subpopulations. Many important problems however require the prediction of a real-valued outcome, such as a risk score or insurance premium. In such regression settings, measuring group fairness criteria is computationally challenging, as it requires estimating information-theoretic divergences between conditional probability density functions. This paper introduces fast approximations of the independence, separation and sufficiency group fairness criteria for regression models from their (conditional) mutual information definitions, and uses such approximations as regularisers to enforce fairness within a regularised risk minimisation framework. Experiments in real-world datasets indicate that in spite of its superior computational efficiency our algorithm still displays state-of-the-art accuracy fairness tradeoffs.",

A popular approach to entity extraction is based on matching sub-string candidates in a document against a dictionary of entities. To handle spelling errors and name variations of entities, usually the matching is approximate and edit or Jaccard distance is used to measure dissimilarity between sub-string candidates and the entities. For approximate entity extraction from free text, existing work considers solely character-based or solely token-based similarity and hence cannot simultaneously deal with minor variations at token level and typos. In this paper, we address this problem by considering both character-based similarity and token-based similarity (i.e. two-level similarity). Measuring one-level (e.g. character-based) similarity is computationally expensive, and measuring two-level similarity is dramatically more expensive. By exploiting the properties of the two-level similarity and the weights of tokens, we develop novel techniques to significantly reduce the number of sub-string candidates that require computation of two-level similarity against the dictionary of entities. A comprehensive experimental study on real world datasets show that our algorithm can efficiently extract entities from documents and produce a high F 1 score in the range of [0.91, 0.97].",

In Experiment 1, participants in the lab solved a series of problems in which they had to re-configure three blocks from an initial to a final configuration. We recorded whether they used one hand or two hands to do so. In Experiment 2, we asked participants online to judge whether they think the person in the lab used one or two hands. The results revealed a close correspondence between participants' actions in the lab, and the mental simulations of participants online. To explain participants' actions and mental simulations, we develop a model that plans over a symbolic representation of the situation, executes the plan using a geometric solver, and checks the plan's feasibility by taking into account the physical constraints of the scene. Our model explains participants' actions and judgments to a high degree of quantitative accuracy.

Overheating results in severe motor deterioration and is thus of high concern for the machine's control strategy and its design. Lack of precise temperature estimations leads to lesser device utilization and higher material cost. In this work, several machine learning (ML) models are empirically evaluated on their estimation accuracy for the task of predicting latent high-dynamic magnet temperature profiles. The range of selected algorithms covers as diverse approaches as possible with ordinary and weighted least squares, support vector regression, k -nearest neighbors, randomized trees and neural networks. Having test bench data available, it is shown that ML approaches relying merely on collected data meet the estimation performance of classical thermal models built on thermodynamic theory, yet not all kinds of models render efficient use of large datasets or sufficient modeling capacities. Especially linear regression and simple feed-forward neural networks with optimized hyperparameters mark strong predictive quality at low to moderate model sizes.",

In this paper, we propose Adversarial Mutual Information (AMI): a text generation framework which is formed as a novel saddle point (min-max) optimization aiming to identify joint interactions between the source and target. Within this framework, the forward and backward networks are able to iteratively promote or demote each other's generated instances by comparing the real and synthetic data distributions. We also develop a latent noise sampling strategy that leverages random variations at the high-level semantic space to enhance the long term dependency in the generation process. Extensive experiments based on different text generation tasks demonstrate that the proposed AMI framework can significantly outperform several strong baselines, and we also show that AMI has potential to lead to a tighter lower bound of maximum mutual information for the variational information maximization problem.",

While tremendous progresses have been achieved via scalable Bayesian sampling such as stochastic gradient MCMC (SG-MCMC) and Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), the generated samples are typically highly correlated. Moreover, their sample-generation processes are often criticized to be inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel self-adversarial learning framework that automatically learns a conditional generator to mimic the behavior of a Markov kernel (transition kernel). High-quality samples can be efficiently generated by direct forward passes though a learned generator. Most importantly, the learning process adopts a self-learning paradigm, requiring no information on existing Markov kernels, e.g. , knowledge of how to draw samples from them. Specifically, our framework learns to use current samples, either from the generator or pre-provided training data, to update the generator such that the generated samples progressively approach a target distribution, thus it is called self-learning. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets verify advantages of our framework, outperforming related methods in terms of both sampling efficiency and sample quality.",

You get a lot of food for your money, which I was excited about. But when I started eating my Pad Fresh Ginger, I noticed the flavors were all over the place. One bite was way too salty, another bite was funky. The quality of the chicken seemed to be pretty good, and was plentiful. But overall, it just tasted unpleasant and was very greasy. The lunch special came with a cup of soup and an egg roll. The soup tasted fine, but was only sparsely adorned with vegetables. The eggroll was a greasy, bland little nugget. My friend ordered the Ka Pow, which was equally greasy and underwhelming. Our server was fine, and the space was inviting enough. Too bad the food was pretty forgettable. I would not recommend this place.",

The charge cycle starts at a fixed current. As the cell charges, its voltage rises. This is the fastest part of the charge. When the voltage reaches 4.2 Vcell, the charger switches to a fixed voltage charge until the current reduces below some threshold and charging ends. This second part gets slower as the cells become full, because the difference between the cell's present state and its end state becomes smaller. That smaller difference leads to lower current and thus longer charge time.,Two reasons. The basic physics reason is the voltage difference. If you put 5V in to charge a flat battery at 2.7V more electricity can flow than into a charged 3.6V battery. The second is to protect the battery. Slowing down the charge when it is full helps increase the number of charge cycles a battery can go through before it loses capacity.','Think of it like blowing up a balloon.

Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three outcomes.

If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing. Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which heshe was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible.

The Company soon expanded its territories around its bases in Bombay and Madras; the Anglo-Mysore Wars and later the Anglo-Maratha Wars led to control of the vast regions of India. Ahom Kingdom of North-east India first fell to Burmese invasion and then to British after Treaty of Yandabo in 1826. Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Kashmir were annexed after the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849; however, Kashmir was immediately sold under the Treaty of Amritsar to the Dogra Dynasty of Jammu and thereby became a princely state. The border dispute between Nepal and British India, which sharpened after 1801, had caused the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-16 and brought the defeated Gurkhas under British influence. In 1854, Berar was annexed, and the state of Oudh was added two years later.",

By considering a game between \"Market\" and \"Investor\" in discrete time, the pricing problem is reduced to a backward induction of an optimization over simplexes. For European options with payoff functions satisfying a combinatorial property called submodularity or supermodularity, this optimization is solved in closed form by using the Lovasz extension and the upper and lower hedging prices can be calculated efficiently. This class includes the options on the maximum or the minimum of several assets. We also study the asymptotic behavior as the number of game rounds goes to infinity. The upper and lower hedging prices of European options converge to the solutions of the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equations. For European options with submodular or supermodular payoff functions, the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation is reduced to the linear Black-Scholes equation and it is solved in closed form.

For this channel, it has been known that when all receivers have channel state information (CSIR), the degrees of freedom (DoF) cannot be improved beyond what is available via TDMA. The same is true if none of the receivers possess CSIR. This paper shows that an entirely new scenario emerges when receivers have unequal CSIR. In particular, orthogonal transmission is no longer DoF-optimal when one receiver has CSIR and the other does not. A multiplicative superposition is proposed for this scenario and shown to attain the optimal degrees of freedom under a wide set of antenna configurations and coherence lengths. Two signaling schemes are constructed based on the multiplicative superposition. In the first method, the messages of the two receivers are carried in the row and column spaces of a matrix, respectively. This method works better than orthogonal transmission while reception at each receiver is still interference-free. The second method uses coherent signaling for the receiver with CSIR, and Grassmannian signaling for the receiver without CSIR. This second method requires interference cancellation at the receiver with CSIR, but achieves higher DoF than the first method.",

In an experiment where a robot arm has to learn to use a flexible fishing line , we illustrate that SGIM-D efficiently combines the advantages of social learning and intrinsic motivation and benefits from human demonstration properties to learn how to produce varied outcomes in the environment, while developing more precise control policies in large spaces.",

Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse between the end of his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.",

Ervin Staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing. They lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy. A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim, past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds, authoritarian cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and external witnesses (bystanders) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide. Intense conflict between groups that is unresolved, becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide. The conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention, such as humanizing a devalued group, creating ideologies that embrace all groups, and activating bystander responses. There is substantial research to indicate how this can be done, but information is only slowly transformed into action.",

Unfortunately, such blockage effects are either neglected or characterized by oversimplified models in the analysis of cellular networks. Leveraging concepts from random shape theory, this paper proposes a mathematical framework to model random blockages and analyze their impact on cellular network performance. Random buildings are modeled as a process of rectangles with random sizes and orientations whose centers form a Poisson point process on the plane. The distribution of the number of blockages in a link is proven to be Poisson random variable with parameter dependent on the length of the link. A path loss model that incorporates the blockage effects is proposed, which matches experimental trends observed in prior work. The model is applied to analyze the performance of cellular networks in urban areas with the presence of buildings, in terms of connectivity, coverage probability, and average rate. Analytic results show while buildings may block the desired signal, they may still have a positive impact on network performance since they can block significantly more interference.",

A key priority in the design was ease of implementation of both new optimizers and new objective functions to be optimized; therefore, implementation of a new optimizer requires only one method and implementation of a new objective function requires at most four functions. This leads to simple and intuitive code, which, for fast prototyping and experimentation, is of paramount importance.

We show that its performance can be improved by introducing a weighted sequence estimation scheme at the receiver. Moreover, we perform bit-to-symbol mapping optimization to reduce the bit-error rate (BER) of the system. Furthermore, we carry out a detailed comparison with classical schemes based on pulse-amplitude modulation and maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD). Our investigation shows that for a reference 42Gbs transmission, the SBRNN autoencoder achieves a BER performance comparable to MLSD, when both systems account for the same amount of memory.

We present a framework for the extraction of features that can be used for abstraction with supervised learning methods that is based on the XES IEEE standard for event logs. This framework can automatically abstract sensor-level events to their interpretation at the human activity level, after training it on training data for which both the sensor and human activity events are known.

This Serengeti Migration of the wildebeest is a curious spectacle listed among the 10 Natural Wonders of Africa.",

The commission was set up last year to promote and protect human rights in the state. This is its first report. Speaking on RTE's Morning Ireland programme, Chief Commissioner Emily Logan said the government had failed to meet basic human rights standards required under international law - in the stark choices made during the recession. There was an absence of any human rights or equality assessment of the \"troika\" (EU, IMF and European Central Bank) bail-out programme. This meant those who were already disadvantaged were even more susceptible to unemployment, lower incomes or poorer living standards. People with disabilities experienced the impact of austerity measures more acutely, with the rate of unemployment almost trebling among this group - from 8 to 22 during the recession. The report, published on Thursday, comes ahead of a UN Committee in Geneva next week where Ireland will be asked to defend its record on human rights.",

The metaphysics of light in the Middle Ages led to clerical belief in its divinity and the importance of its display in holy settings. Much of this belief was based on the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius, a sixth-century mystic whose book, The Celestial Hierarchy, was popular among monks in France. Pseudo-Dionysius held that all light, even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows, was divine. To promote such faith, the abbot in charge of the Saint-Denis church on the north edge of Paris, the Abbot Suger, encouraged architects remodeling the building to make the interior as bright as possible.",

In order to model and generate scenarios of trajectories with different length, we develop two approaches. First, we adapt the Recurrent Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (RC-GAN) by conditioning on the length of the trajectories. This provides us flexibility to generate variable-length driving trajectories, a desirable feature for scenario test case generation in the verification of self-driving cars. Second, we develop an architecture based on Recurrent Autoencoder with GANs in order to obviate the variable length issue, wherein we train a GAN to learngenerate the latent representations of original trajectories. In this approach, we train an integrated feed-forward neural network to estimate the length of the trajectories to be able to bring them back from the latent space representation. In addition to trajectory generation, we employ the trained autoencoder as a feature extractor, for the purpose of clustering and anomaly detection, in order to obtain further insights on the collected scenario dataset. We experimentally investigate the performance of the proposed framework on real-world scenario trajectories obtained from in-field data collection.",

In this paper, we present two techniques for improving encoding representations for similarity metrics: a batch-mean centering strategy that improves statistical properties; and a computationally efficient tempered Word Mover Distance, for better fusion of the information in the contextualized word representations. We conduct numerical experiments that demonstrate the robustness of our techniques, reporting results over various BERT-backbone learned metrics and achieving state of the art correlation with human ratings on several benchmarks.",

While there have been sustained efforts to make these models more data-efficient, the potential benefit of understanding the data itself, is largely untapped. Specifically, focusing on object recognition tasks, we wonder if for common benchmark datasets we can do better than random subsets of the data and find a subset that can generalize on par with the full dataset when trained on. To our knowledge, this is the first result that can find notable redundancies in CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets (at least 10).

The feasible region is the intersection of several discs formed by the NLOS measurements. We show how we can reduce the size of the optimization problem and formulate it as a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which depends on the Cholesky factor of the a posteriori error covariance matrix of SRUKF. As a result of these modifications, the proposed constrained SRUKF (CSRUKF) is more efficient and has better numerical stability compared to the constrained UKF.

I like Ray Charles, I was not his fan, but it is amazing the resemblance of Jamie Foxx with him. The film is completely supported by Jamie Foxx, who participates of most of the shootings, and his movements on stage looks like as if he was a reincarnation of Ray Charles. With regard to the story, I saw the extended version on DVD, too long but also very pleasant, with many beautiful songs and scenes showing mainly a junkie Ray Charles. My greatest surprise was to find that Ray Charles was heroine addicted, and how he treated his own family. The presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Ray\"",

When a breakup happens, often there is a craving for human contact (most of the time the subject is craving the ex).

Relationships often have the honeymoon phase, comfortable phase, etc. (I realize I'm not being very scientific here, but romantic love doesn't exactly have many scientific journals on it) This seems very similar to the tolerance that many addicts experience (first experience with a drug seems to be the most intense).

The refinement procedure is proved to converge in the single R -D mode case.

This problem has been considered to be a highly complex and computationally intractable problem, and most research related to this topic focuses on very small case studies or used heuristic methods and has lead most studies about TNEP in the technical literature to take a wide spectrum of simplifying assumptions. In this paper an adaptive robust transmission network expansion planning formulation is proposed for keeping the full dynamic complexity of the problem.

Despite its potential for addressing fundamental issues in deep learning, singular learning theory appears to have made little inroads into the developing canon of deep learning theory. Via a mix of theory and experiment, we present an invitation to singular learning theory as a vehicle for understanding deep learning and suggest important future work to make singular learning theory directly applicable to how deep learning is performed in practice.",

He postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory. Later research showed this to be false. Research has shown that direct injections of cortisol or epinephrine help the storage of recent experiences. This is also true for stimulation of the amygdala. This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala. Excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage. Patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones. The hippocampus is important for explicit memory. The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation. The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also. The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already. Hippocampal damage may also cause memory loss and problems with memory storage. This memory loss includes, retrograde amnesia which is the loss of memory for events that occurred shortly before the time of brain damage.",

For the auditory content, a minimalistic set of parameters such as prosodic, excitation, vocal tract, and spectral descriptors are used as features. The fusion of these two modalities is carried out at a feature level, before training a single support vector regressor (SVR) or at a prediction level, after training one SVR for each modality. The proposed approach also includes preprocessing and post-processing techniques which contribute favorably to improving the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Experimental results for predicting spontaneous and natural emotions on the RECOLA dataset have shown that the proposed approach takes advantage of the complementary information of visual and auditory modalities and provides CCCs of 0.749 and 0.565 for arousal and valence, respectively.",

        "text": "Visual odometry networks commonly use pretrained optical flow networks in order to derive the ego-motion between consecutive frames. The features extracted by these networks represent the motion of all the pixels between frames. However, due to the existence of dynamic objects and texture-less surfaces in the scene, the motion information for every image region might not be reliable for inferring odometry due to the ineffectiveness of dynamic objects in derivation of the incremental changes in position. Recent works in this area lack attention mechanisms in their structures to facilitate dynamic reweighing of the feature maps for extracting more refined egomotion information. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of self-attention in visual odometry. We report qualitative and quantitative results against the SOTA methods. Furthermore, saliency-based studies alongside specially designed experiments are utilized to investigate the effect of self-attention on VO. Our experiments show that using self-attention allows for the extraction of better features while achieving a better odometry performance compared to networks that lack such structures.",

Specifically, we show that the distribution of this optimum is the Wasserstein barycenter of the distributions induced by the standard regression function on the sensitive groups. This result offers an intuitive interpretation of the optimal fair prediction and suggests a simple post-processing algorithm to achieve fairness.

One common and two private messages are transmitted and the private message to the cooperative user should be kept secret from the cooperation-aided user.

An inner bound on the capacity region is derived by using a channel-resolvability-based code that double-bins the codebook of the secret message, and by using a likelihood encoder to choose the transmitted codeword. The inner bound is shown to be tight for semi-deterministic and physically degraded BCs and the results are compared to those of the corresponding BCs without a secrecy constraint. Blackwell and Gaussian BC examples illustrate the impact of secrecy on the rate regions. Unlike the case without secrecy, where sharing information about both private messages via the cooperative link is optimal, our protocol conveys parts of the common and non-confidential messages only. This restriction reduces the transmission rates more than the usual rate loss due to secrecy requirements. An example that shows this loss can be strict is also provided.",

We observe that the parasitic voltage drops create a significant asymmetry in programming speed and reliability of NVM cells in a crossbar. Specifically, NVM cells that are on shorter current paths are faster to program but have lower endurance than those on longer current paths, and vice versa. This asymmetry in neuromorphic architectures create reliability-performance trade-offs, which can be exploited efficiently using SNN mapping techniques.

Among others, i-vector and x-vector have emerged as the mainstream methods for speaker embedding. In this paper, we illustrate the use of modern computation platform to harness the benefit of GPU acceleration for i-vector extraction. In particular, we achieve an acceleration of 3000 times in frame posterior computation compared to real time and 25 times in training the i-vector extractor compared to the CPU baseline from Kaldi toolkit. This significant speed-up allows the exploration of ideas that were hitherto impossible. In particular, we show that it is beneficial to update the universal background model (UBM) and re-compute frame alignments while training the i-vector extractor. Additionally, we are able to study different variations of i-vector extractors more rigorously than before. In this process, we reveal some undocumented details of Kaldi's i-vector extractor and show that it outperforms the standard formulation by a margin of 1 to 2 when tested with VoxCeleb speaker verification protocol. All of our findings are asserted by ensemble averaging the results from multiple runs with random start.",

Recent research has demonstrated that the effect of cognitive biases, anchoring bias in particular, transfers to information visualization and visual analytics. However, it is still unclear how users of visual interfaces can be anchored and the impact of anchoring on user performance and decision-making process. To investigate, we performed two rounds of between-subjects, in-laboratory experiments with 94 participants to analyze the effect of visual anchors and strategy cues in decision-making with a visual analytic system that employs coordinated multiple view design. The decision-making task is identifying misinformation from Twitter news accounts. Participants were randomly assigned one of three treatment groups (including control) in which participant training processes were modified. Our findings reveal that strategy cues and visual anchors (scenario videos) can significantly affect user activity, speed, confidence, and, under certain circumstances, accuracy. We discuss the implications of our experiment results on training users how to use a newly developed visual interface. We call for more careful consideration into how visualization designers and researchers train users to avoid unintentionally anchoring users and thus affecting the end result.",

We test the validity of triangles formed by three points, and mark a triangle as broken if its triangle inequality does not hold. The premise of our work is that unlike inliers, outlier distances tend to break many triangles. Our method is tested and its performance is evaluated on various datasets and distributions of outliers.

Since the derivative of the fixed-point with respect to the parameter can usually not be evaluated exactly, one approach is to introduce an adjoint dynamical system to estimate gradients. Using this estimation procedure, the optimization algorithm alternates between derivative estimation and an approximate gradient descent step. We analyze a variant of this approach involving dynamic time-scaling, where after each parameter update the adjoint system is iterated until a convergence threshold is passed. We prove that, under certain conditions, the algorithm can find approximate stationary points of the objective function. We demonstrate the approach in the settings of an inverse problem in chemical kinetics, and learning in attractor networks.",

We have previously shown that arterial pulsations from the heart beat are not strong enough to drive waste clearance . Here we demonstrate computational evidence for a mechanism for cerebral waste clearance that is driven by functional hyperaemia, that is, the dilation of cerebral arteries as a consequence of increased neuronal demand. This mechanism is based on our model for fluid flow through the vascular basement membrane .

Unlike previous approaches, the proposed method is both more efficient, due to its use of an iterative temporal feedback loop that massively improves convergence to a noise-free approximant, and more flexible, due to its introduction of a spatio-directional hashing representation that allows to encode directional variations like those due to glossy reflections. We then introduce four different methods to employ the resulting approximations to control the underlying path sampler andor modify its associated estimator, greatly reducing its variance and enhancing its robustness to complex lighting scenarios. The core algorithms are highly scalable and low-overhead, requiring only minor modifications to an existing path tracer.",

We re-examine the relationship between globalization and regionalization by viewing the international trade system as an interdependent complex network. We use the modularity optimization method to detect communities and community cores in the ITN during the years . We find rich dynamics over time both inter- and intra-communities. Most importantly, we have a multilevel description of the evolution where the global dynamics (i.e., communities disappear or reemerge) tend to be correlated with the regional dynamics (i.e., community core changes between community members). In particular, the Asia-Oceania community disappeared and reemerged over time along with a switch in leadership from Japan to China. Moreover, simulation results show that the global dynamics can be generated by a preferential attachment mechanism both inter- and intra- communities.",

It turns out that the amount of reactance seen at the terminals of a resonant antenna when the frequency is shifted, say, by 5, depends very much on the diameter of the conductor used. A long thin wire used as a half-wave dipole (or quarter wave monopole) will have a reactance significantly greater than the resistive impedance it has at resonance, leading to a poor match and generally unacceptable performance. Making the element using a tube of a diameter perhaps 150 of its length, however, results in a reactance at this altered frequency which is not so great, and a much less serious mismatch which will only modestly damage the antenna's net performance. Thus rather thick tubes are typically used for the solid elements of such antennas, including Yagi-Uda arrays.",

In this paper, a novel feedback network named CRNet is proposed to achieve better performance via extracting CSI features on multiple resolutions. An advanced training scheme that further boosts the network performance is also introduced. Simulation results show that the proposed CRNet outperforms the state-of-the-art CsiNet under the same computational complexity without any extra information. The open source codes are available at",

This implies that the onboard sensors cover the current flight direction. Due to the limited payload of MAVs, full sensor coverage of the environment has to be traded off with flight time. Thus, often only a part of the environment is covered. We present a combined allocentric complete planning and trajectory optimization approach taking these sensor visibility constraints into account. The optimized trajectories yield flight paths within the apex angle of a Velodyne Puck Lite 3D laser scanner enabling low-level collision avoidance to perceive obstacles in the flight direction. Furthermore, the optimized trajectories take the flight dynamics into account and contain the velocities and accelerations along the path.

To guarantee the reliability of autonomous vehicles, an L 1 adaptive controller, which compensates for uncertainties and disturbances, is employed by the Simplex architecture as a verified safe controller to tolerate concurrent software and physical failures. Meanwhile, safe switching controller is incorporated into Simplex to achieve the safe velocity tracking through integration of the traction control system (TCS) and anti-lock braking system (ABS). Specifically, the vehicle's velocity asymptotically tracks its provided references that vary with driving environments, while restricts its wheel slip to safe sets to prevent slipping and sliding. Due to the high dependence of the vehicle dynamics on the operational environment, Simplex leverages finite-time model learning to timely learn and update the vehicle model for L 1 adaptive controller, when any deviation from the safety envelope or the uncertainty measurement threshold occurs in unforeseen driving environments. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed L 1 -Simplex with model learning in different scenarios.",

The smart vest uses two dry bi-electrodes to record a single lead ECG signal. The biopotential signal is then streamed via a gateway to the cloud where a neural network detects and classifies the heart arrhythmias. We selected an architecture that combines convolutional and recurrent layers. The convolutional layers extract relevant features from sliding windows of ECG and the recurrent layer aggregates them for a final softmax layer that performs the classification.

The controller is designed to facilitate building operation during normal conditions and demand response events, while ensuring occupants comfort and energy efficiency. We leverage a continuous action space RL formulation, and devise a two-stage global-local RL training framework. In the first stage, a global fast policy search is performed using a gradient-free RL algorithm. In the second stage, a local fine-tuning is conducted using a policy gradient method. In contrast to the state-of-the-art model predictive control (MPC) approach, the proposed RL controller does not require complex computation during real-time operation and can adapt to non-linear building models. We illustrate the controller performance numerically using a five-zone commercial building.",

Based on new discoveries on astrocytes in regulating synaptic transmission in the brain, this paper has mapped stigmergy mechanism into the interaction between synapses and investigated its characteristics and advantages. Particularly, we have divided the interaction between synapses which are not directly connected into three phases and proposed a stigmergic learning model. In this model, the state change of a stigmergy agent will expand its influence to affect the states of others. The strength of the interaction is determined by the level of neural activity as well as the distance between stigmergy agents. Inspired by the morphological and functional changes in astrocytes during environmental enrichment, it is likely that the regulation of distance between stigmergy agents plays a critical role in the stigmergy learning process. Simulation results have verified its importance and indicated that the well-regulated distance between stigmergy agents can help to obtain stigmergy learning gain.",

Remarkably, the architecture itself enables mechanisms of abstraction and generalization, two features which are often considered key ingredients for artificial intelligence.

In benign settings, NACKs are beneficial for ICN architectures, such as CCNx and NDN, since they flush state in routers and notify consumers. In terms of security, NACKs seem useful as they can help mitigating so-called Interest Flooding attacks.

We consider several types of NACKs and discuss their security design requirements and implications.

Additionally, a simple yet effective temporal action proposal scheme, dubbed temporal actionness grouping (TAG) is devised to generate high quality action proposals.

Most state-of-the-art models do not take time into account and give feature maps constant weights across the stimulus duration. However, visual exploration is a highly dynamic process shaped by many time-dependent factors. For instance, some systematic viewing patterns such as the center bias are known to dramatically vary across the time course of the exploration. In this paper, we use maximum likelihood and shrinkage methods to dynamically and jointly learn feature map and systematic viewing pattern weights directly from eye-tracking data recorded on videos. We show that these weights systematically vary as a function of time, and heavily depend upon the semantic visual category of the videos being processed. Our fusion method allows taking these variations into account, and outperforms other state-of-the-art fusion schemes using constant weights over time.

Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5 mg a day, vs. about 1 mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.",

However, to further apply AI technologies in real-world context, several significant issues regarding the AI ecosystem should be addressed. We identify the main issues as data privacy, ownership, and exchange, which are difficult to be solved with the current centralized paradigm of machine learning training methodology. As a result, we propose a novel model training paradigm based on blockchain, named Galaxy Learning, which aims to train a model with distributed data and to reserve the data ownership for their owners. In this new paradigm, encrypted models are moved around instead, and are federated once trained. Model training, as well as the communication, is achieved with blockchain and its smart contracts. Pricing of training data is determined by its contribution, and therefore it is not about the exchange of data ownership. In this position paper, we describe the motivation, paradigm, design, and challenges as well as opportunities of Galaxy Learning.",

The combination of visual and textual content in the same message builds up a modern way of communication, that automatic systems are not used to deal with. In this paper we extend recent advances in emoji prediction by putting forward a multimodal approach that is able to predict emojis in Instagram posts. Instagram posts are composed of pictures together with texts which sometimes include emojis. We show that these emojis can be predicted by using the text, but also using the picture. Our main finding is that incorporating the two synergistic modalities, in a combined model, improves accuracy in an emoji prediction task. This result demonstrates that these two modalities (text and images) encode different information on the use of emojis and therefore can complement each other.",

Using PAF-R-specific small interfering RNA, it was demonstrated that silencing of endogenous PAF-R expression significantly attenuated cell migration induced by PAF, but not PDGF-BB, suggesting the specific involvement of PAF-R in the oxLDL-induced cell migration.

An emerging approach for conducting such assessments in the United States is through the US Road Assessment Program (usRAP), which rates roads from highest risk (1 star) to lowest (5 stars). Obtaining these ratings requires manual, fine-grained labeling of roadway features in street-level panoramas, a slow and costly process. We propose to automate this process using a deep convolutional neural network that directly estimates the star rating from a street-level panorama, requiring milliseconds per image at test time. Our network also estimates many other road-level attributes, including curvature, roadside hazards, and the type of median. To support this, we incorporate task-specific attention layers so the network can focus on the panorama regions that are most useful for a particular task. We evaluated our approach on a large dataset of real-world images from two US states. We found that incorporating additional tasks, and using a semi-supervised training approach, significantly reduced overfitting problems, allowed us to optimize more layers of the network, and resulted in higher accuracy.",

Inspiration is taken from two recent developments in the cognitive science literature: predictive processing theories of cognition, and the sensorimotor contingencies theory of perception. Based on these, a hypothesis is formulated about what the content of information might be that is encoded in an internal world model, and how an agent could autonomously acquire it.

Players bid to move and the player with the highest bid wins the move, and hands over the winning bidding amount to the other player. The new game is dubbed Bidding Cumulative Subtraction (BCS). In so-called unitary games, players remove exactly one item out of a single heap of identical items, until the heap is empty, and their actions contribute to a common score, which increases or decreases by one unit depending on whether the maximizing player won the turn or not. We show that there is a unique bidding equilibrium for a much larger class of games, that generalize standard scoring play in the literature.

Descartes's work, along with Avicenna's, prefigured the 19th-century development of specificity theory. Specificity theory saw pain as \"a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses.\" Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory, which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality, but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature. By the mid-1890s, specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians, and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists. However, after a series of clinical observations by Henry Head and experiments by Max von Frey, the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse, and by century's end, most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact.",

Nothing is priced in the store so he just wings the pricing by only looking at Popsike, an extremely inaccurate listing of eBay auctions that have ended. He refuses to look at Discogs, which is way more accurate and up to date. He also refuses to use eBay, which at first was very commendable but I quickly realized why. Enjoy the store, enjoying looking at the vast amount of records that are a part of history, but know what things are worth before checking out. I went back and forth on pricing for almost an hour and ended up saving 175 off his original price at the register. I spent so much time arguing about price that I ended up not enjoying my experience at all. With that said, check out Moondog Records in Vegas instead.

We then develop a decentralized distributed optimization framework to enhance the system performance by mitigating the impact of errors via a distributed linear data-fusion scheme.

Because of its particular bandgap, it's a better sensor for infrared wavelengths than for visible light. And longer wavelengths (redinfrared) scatter less than smaller wavelengths (blue). So what this means is that the camera is simply better at sensing the part of light that scatters less. The human eye is best at sensing green light which has a smaller wavelength than red or infrared. Therefore by its design, it is just more sensitive to the part of light that scatters more.",

        "text": "Asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) is a popular parallel optimization algorithm in machine learning. Most theoretical analysis on ASGD take a discrete view and prove upper bounds for their convergence rates. However, the discrete view has its intrinsic limitations: there is no characterization of the optimization path and the proof techniques are induction-based and thus usually complicated. Inspired by the recent successful adoptions of stochastic differential equations (SDE) to the theoretical analysis of SGD, in this paper, we study the continuous approximation of ASGD by using stochastic differential delay equations (SDDE). We introduce the approximation method and study the approximation error. Then we conduct theoretical analysis on the convergence rates of ASGD algorithm based on the continuous approximation. There are two methods: moment estimation and energy function minimization can be used to analyze the convergence rates. Moment estimation depends on the specific form of the loss function, while energy function minimization only leverages the convex property of the loss function, and does not depend on its specific form. In addition to the convergence analysis, the continuous view also helps us derive better convergence rates. All of this clearly shows the advantage of taking the continuous view in gradient descent algorithms.",

I believe the teachers unions are more in it for themselves and don't really care about educating our kids beyond teaching the test, as it were. I think giving parents school choices will create competition so that schools will improve or close down. So to me it would virtually make all schools equal and reduce the number of private schools. It could be implemented by vastly reducing the Dept. of Education to the point that all they do is provide vouchers and set hard line curricula. We know that sending kids to private schools isn't cheap, but we spend more per student per year compared to other first world countries. So really I think that we could save money and improve the education system by using a voucher system.",

These conversions gave rise to the Lexington-class aircraft carriers (1927), Akagi and Courageous class. Specialist carrier evolution was well underway, with several navies ordering and building warships that were purposefully designed to function as aircraft carriers by the mid-1920s, resulting in the commissioning of ships such as Hosho (1922), HMS Hermes (1924), and Bearn (1927).

Highlight detection has the potential to significantly ease video browsing, but existing methods often suffer from expensive supervision requirements, where human viewers must manually identify highlights in training videos. We propose a scalable unsupervised solution that exploits video duration as an implicit supervision signal. Our key insight is that video segments from shorter user-generated videos are more likely to be highlights than those from longer videos, since users tend to be more selective about the content when capturing shorter videos. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel ranking framework that prefers segments from shorter videos, while properly accounting for the inherent noise in the (unlabeled) training data. We use it to train a highlight detector with 10M hashtagged Instagram videos. In experiments on two challenging public video highlight detection benchmarks, our method substantially improves the state-of-the-art for unsupervised highlight detection.",

However, most of the existing works usually studied one of these two sub-tasks alone, which hinders their practical use. This paper aims to solve the complete task of target-based sentiment analysis in an end-to-end fashion, and presents a novel unified model which applies a unified tagging scheme. Our framework involves two stacked recurrent neural networks: The upper one predicts the unified tags to produce the final output results of the primary target-based sentiment analysis; The lower one performs an auxiliary target boundary prediction aiming at guiding the upper network to improve the performance of the primary task. To explore the inter-task dependency, we propose to explicitly model the constrained transitions from target boundaries to target sentiment polarities. We also propose to maintain the sentiment consistency within an opinion target via a gate mechanism which models the relation between the features for the current word and the previous word. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and our framework achieves consistently superior results.",

In this work, we suggest the approach of Synchronized Software Development (SSD), which promotes a new mechanism of collaboration in general, and for code synchronization in particular. In SSD, code changes made by one developer are automatically propagated to others as long as they keep the code free of compilation errors. Changes that introduce compilation errors are not propagated until the errors are fixed. Moreover, other developers are restricted from concurrently editing the entities involved in these changes. While in this state, developers are, however, free to modify the rest of the entities. The novelty of our approach is that it actively synchronizes developers with the latest error free version of the source code, preventing possible conflicts and merges that may arise due to concurrent changes made by fellow team members. SSD also allows for a more transparent an practically near real time awareness of new code that is being introduced by multiple developers.

We formulate WWAE as minimization of the penalized optimal transport between the target distribution and the generated distribution. By noticing that both the prior P Z and the aggregated posterior Q Z of the latent code Z can be well captured by Gaussians, the proposed WWAE utilizes the closed-form of the squared Wasserstein-2 distance for two Gaussians in the optimization process. As a result, WWAE does not suffer from the sampling burden and it is computationally efficient by leveraging the reparameterization trick. Numerical results evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets including MNIST, fashion- MNIST and CelebA show that WWAE learns better latent structures than VAEs and generates samples of better visual quality and higher FID scores than VAEs and GANs.",

Amino acid loses its amino NH3) group by deaminating (removes the amino group) or transaminating (transfers the amino group out) enzymes, which converts the amino acid into a citric acid cycle metabolite. 2. Entering the citric acid cycle allows the metabolite derived from the amino acid to be used in the regeneration of oxaloacetate. 3. Oxaloacetate is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by PEP carboxykinase. 4. PEP can now enter a pathway that looks like the reverse of the glycolytic but it differs by two enzymes.

        "text": "Markov random fields (MRFs) have been widely used as prior models in various inverse problems such as tomographic reconstruction. While MRFs provide a simple and often effective way to model the spatial dependencies in images, they suffer from the fact that parameter estimation is difficult. In practice, this means that MRFs typically have very simple structure that cannot completely capture the subtle characteristics of complex images. In this paper, we present a novel Gaussian mixture Markov random field model (GM-MRF) that can be used as a very expressive prior model for inverse problems such as denoising and reconstruction. The GM-MRF forms a global image model by merging together individual Gaussian-mixture models (GMMs) for image patches. In addition, we present a novel analytical framework for computing MAP estimates using the GM-MRF prior model through the construction of surrogate functions that result in a sequence of quadratic optimizations. We also introduce a simple but effective method to adjust the GM-MRF so as to control the sharpness in low- and high-contrast regions of the reconstruction separately. We demonstrate the value of the model with experiments including image denoising and low-dose CT reconstruction.",

Aiming to alleviate this common issue, we introduce sequential greedy architecture search (SGAS), an efficient method for neural architecture search. By dividing the search procedure into sub-problems, SGAS chooses and prunes candidate operations in a greedy fashion. We apply SGAS to search architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Extensive experiments show that SGAS is able to find state-of-the-art architectures for tasks such as image classification, point cloud classification and node classification in protein-protein interaction graphs with minimal computational cost.",

Building robust classifier for the PU problem is very challenging, especially for complex data where the negative samples overwhelm and mislabeled samples or corrupted features exist. To address these three issues, we propose a robust learning framework that unifies AUC maximization (a robust metric for biased labels), outlier detection (for excluding wrong labels), and feature selection (for excluding corrupted features). The generalization error bounds are provided for the proposed model that give valuable insight into the theoretical performance of the method and lead to useful practical guidance, e.g., to train a model, we find that the included unlabeled samples are sufficient as long as the sample size is comparable to the number of positive samples in the training process. Empirical comparisons and two real-world applications on surgical site infection (SSI) and EEG seizure detection are also conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

This method is data-driven, yet unlike other data-driven models such as neural networks, it yields an explicit control-oriented linear model rather than just a \"black-box\" input-output mapping. This work describes this Koopman-based system identification method and its application to model predictive controller design. A model and MPC controller of a pneumatic soft robot arm is constructed via the method, and its performance is evaluated over several trajectory following tasks in the real-world.

The resulting method dynamically utilizes data from an external source, such as a large set of questionsanswers or imagescaptions. Concretely, we learn a set of base weights for a simple VQA model, that are specifically adapted to a given question with the information specifically retrieved for this question. The adaptation process leverages recent advances in gradient-based meta learning and contributions for efficient retrieval and cross-domain adaptation. We surpass the state-of-the-art on the VQA-CP v2 benchmark and demonstrate our approach to be intrinsically more robust to out-of-distribution test data.

To investigate a segmental implication in the neuropathic pain induced by dopamine depletion, the expression of the isoform gamma of the protein kinase C (PKCg) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 12 (pERK12) was explored in the medullary dorsal horn (MDH). There was a high increase in PKCg expression in the III and IIi laminae of the MDH of lesioned-animals compared to shams. pERK12 expression was also significantly high in the ipsilateral MDH of lesioned rats in response to non-noxious tactile stimulus of the orofacial region. Since pERK12 is expressed only in response to nociceptive stimuli in the dorsal spinal horn, the current study demonstrates that non-noxious stimuli evoke allodynic response. Intraperitoneal and intracisternal administrations of bromocriptine, a dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) agonist, significantly decreased DMA compared to control rats injected with saline. These data demonstrate for the first time that nigrostriatal dopaminergic depletion produces trigeminal neuropathic pain that at least involves a segmental mechanism.

Also, the atrocities that the German army commited are similar to those commited by other armies in other wars. The only reason why nazism is seen as the symbol of evil nowadays is because the US fought against them in WW2 and the US wants an image of \"saviors of the world.\" So basically, the whole western world is still under influence of war propaganda from 70 years ago and can't consider nazism with objectivity.

In this paper, we extend this setting by considering the environment is not given, but controllable and learnable through its interaction with the agent at the same time. This extension is motivated by environment design scenarios in the real-world, including game design, shopping space design and traffic signal design. Theoretically, we find a dual Markov decision process (MDP) w.r.t. the environment to that w.r.t. the agent, and derive a policy gradient solution to optimizing the parametrized environment. Furthermore, discontinuous environments are addressed by a proposed general generative framework. Our experiments on a Maze game design task show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in generating diverse and challenging Mazes against various agent settings.",

If a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt, these can draw water from the body into the bowel and cause osmotic diarrhea. Osmotic diarrhea can also be the result of maldigestion (e.g., pancreatic disease or Coeliac disease), in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water. Or it can be caused by osmotic laxatives (which work to alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much magnesium or vitamin C or undigested lactose can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who has lactose intolerance can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products. In persons who have fructose malabsorption, excess fructose intake can also cause diarrhea. High-fructose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorbable and less likely to cause diarrhea. Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol (often found in sugar-free foods) are difficult for the body to absorb and, in large amounts, may lead to osmotic diarrhea. In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when offending agent (e.g. milk, sorbitol) is stopped.",

The main criticism behind this approach, however, has been the restrictive nature of the Lipschitz continuity condition and the conservativeness of the related results. This work deals with an extension to this problem by introducing a more general family of nonlinear functions, namely one-sided Lipschitz functions. The corresponding class of systems is a superset of its well-known Lipschitz counterpart and possesses inherent advantages with respect to conservativeness. In this paper, first the problem of state observer design for this class of systems is established, the challenges are discussed and some analysis-oriented tools are provided. Then, a solution to the observer design problem is proposed in terms of nonlinear matrix inequalities which in turn are converted into numerically efficiently solvable linear matrix inequalities.",

We hypothesize that new resources are of uttermost importance in domains which are not or weakly covered by ImageNet, such as tourism photographs. We first collect noisy Flickr images for tourist points of interest and apply automatic or weakly-supervised reranking techniques to reduce noise. Then, we learn domain adapted models with a standard CNN architecture and compare them to a generic model obtained from ImageNet. Experimental validation is conducted with publicly available datasets, including Oxford5k, INRIA Holidays and Div150Cred.

For the training stage, Picket identifies erroneous training examples that can result in a biased model, while for the deployment stage, Picket flags corrupted query points to a trained machine learning model that due to noise will result to incorrect predictions. Picket is built around a novel self-supervised deep learning model for mixed-type tabular data. Learning this model is fully unsupervised to minimize the burden of deployment, and Picket is designed as a plugin that can increase the robustness of any machine learning pipeline. We evaluate Picket on a diverse array of real-world data considering different corruption models that include systematic and adversarial noise. We show that Picket offers consistently accurate diagnostics during both training and deployment of various models ranging from SVMs to neural networks, beating competing methods of data quality validation in machine learning pipelines.",

On the other hand, dictionary learning does not scale to the size of problems that CNNs can handle, despite being very effective at low-level vision tasks such as denoising and inpainting. Recently, interest has grown in adapting dictionary learning methods for supervised tasks such as classification and inverse problems. We propose two new network layers that are based on dictionary learning: a sparse factorization layer and a convolutional sparse factorization layer, analogous to fully-connected and convolutional layers, respectively. Using our derivations, these layers can be dropped in to existing CNNs, trained together in an end-to-end fashion with back-propagation, and leverage semisupervision in ways classical CNNs cannot. We experimentally compare networks with these two new layers against a baseline CNN. Our results demonstrate that networks with either of the sparse factorization layers are able to outperform classical CNNs when supervised data are few. They also show performance improvements in certain tasks when compared to the CNN with no sparse factorization layers with the same exact number of parameters.",

The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass-forming ability. This ability can be predicted by the rigidity theory.

Proof theoretical studies discovered exponential gaps between normal or cut free proofs and their respective non-normal proofs. The aim of this work is to study how to reduce the weight of propositional deductions. We present the formalism of proof-graphs for purely implicational logic, which are graphs of a specific shape that are intended to capture the logical structure of a deduction. The advantage of this formalism is that formulas can be shared in the reduced proof. In the present paper we give a precise definition of proof-graphs for the minimal implicational logic, together with a normalization procedure for these proof-graphs. In contrast to standard tree-like formalisms, our normalization does not increase the number of nodes, when applied to the corresponding minimal proof-graph representations.",

The cells stimulated to undergo apoptosis appear to use membrane rafts in the death-signaling process by mobilization of rafts to localized regions of the membrane that are now enriched with apoptotic signaling effectors. Fas signaling induces apoptotic raft formation that results in polar condensation, or capping, of the rafts in the late stages of apoptosis. A novel extrusion technique is described that allows localization and enrichment of rafts into membrane vesicles, which can be assayed by flow cytometry. Cholesterol depletion, after Fas ligand activation of apoptosis, reduced raft formation in cells induced to undergo apoptosis.

A regression performed on such spaces unveils the relationships among system states from which we can derive their generating rules, that is, the most probable set of functions responsible for generating observations along time. In this sense, most approaches rely on Takens' embedding theorem to unfold the phase space, which requires the embedding dimension and the time delay. Moreover, although several methods have been proposed to empirically estimate those parameters, they still face limitations due to their lack of consistency and robustness, which has motivated this paper. As an alternative, we here propose an artificial neural network with a forgetting mechanism to implicitly learn the phase spaces properties, whatever they are. Such network trains on forecasting errors and, after converging, its architecture is used to estimate the embedding parameters.

This makes it hard to recommend appropriate content that matches the student's prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose a refined hierarchical knowledge structure to model vocabulary knowledge, which enables us to automatically organize the authentic and up-to-date learning materials collected from the internet. Based on this knowledge structure, we then introduce a hybrid approach to recommend learning materials that adapts to a student's language level. We evaluate our work with an online Japanese learning tool and the results suggest adding adaptivity into material recommendation significantly increases student engagement.",

In LDA topic modeling, action videos (documents) are represented by a bag-of-words (input from a dictionary), and these are based on improved dense trajectories . The output topics correspond to human motion primitives, such as finger moving or subtle leg motion. We eliminate the impurities, such as missed tracking or changing light conditions, in each motion primitive. The assembled vector of motion primitives is an improved representation of the action.

For example, GNNs cannot distinguish some non-isomorphic graphs (,) and they cannot learn efficient graph algorithms (,), and several GNN models have been proposed to overcome these limitations. In this paper, we demonstrate that GNNs become powerful just by adding a random feature to each node. We prove that the random features enable GNNs to learn almost optimal polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the minimum dominating set problem and maximum matching problem in terms of the approximation ratio. The main advantage of our method is that it can be combined with off-the-shelf GNN models with slight modifications. Through experiments, we show that the addition of random features enables GNNs to solve various problems that normal GNNs, including GCNs and GINs, cannot solve.",

Traditional forecasting methods using mean regression models have severe shortcomings in reflecting real-world fluctuations. While new probabilistic methods rush to rescue, they fight with technical difficulties like quantile crossing or selecting a prior distribution. To meld the different strengths of these fields while avoiding their weaknesses as well as to push the boundary of the state-of-the-art, we introduce ForGAN - one step ahead probabilistic forecasting with generative adversarial networks. ForGAN utilizes the power of the conditional generative adversarial network to learn the data generating distribution and compute probabilistic forecasts from it. We argue how to evaluate ForGAN in opposition to regression methods. To investigate probabilistic forecasting of ForGAN, we create a new dataset and demonstrate our method abilities on it. This dataset will be made publicly available for comparison. Furthermore, we test ForGAN on two publicly available datasets, namely Mackey-Glass dataset and Internet traffic dataset (A5M) where the impressive performance of ForGAN demonstrate its high capability in forecasting future values.",

This paper presents a new federated learning scheme that provides different trade-offs between robustness, privacy, bandwidth efficiency, and model accuracy. Our scheme uses biased quantization of model updates and hence is bandwidth efficient. It is also robust against state-of-the-art backdoor as well as model degradation attacks even when a large proportion of the participant nodes are malicious. We propose a practical differentially private extension of this scheme which protects the whole dataset of participating entities. We show that this extension performs as efficiently as the non-private but robust scheme, even with stringent privacy requirements but are less robust against model degradation and backdoor attacks. This suggests a possible fundamental trade-off between Differential Privacy and robustness.",

Current rain removal methods show limitations either for complex dynamic scenes, or under torrential rain with opaque occlusions. We propose a novel derain framework which applies superpixel (SP) segmentation to decompose the scene into depth consistent units. Alignment of scene contents are done at the SP level, which proves to be robust against rain occlusion interferences and fast camera motion. Two alignment output tensors, i.e., optimal temporal match tensor and sorted spatial-temporal match tensor, provide informative clues for the location of rain streaks and the occluded background contents. Different classical and novel methods such as Robust Principle Component Analysis and Convolutional Neural Networks are applied and compared for their respective advantages in efficiently exploiting the rich spatial-temporal features provided by the two tensors. Extensive evaluations show that advantage of up to 5 dB is achieved on the scene restoration PSNR over state-of-the-art methods, and the advantage is especially obvious with highly complex and dynamic scenes. Visual evaluations show that the proposed framework is not only able to suppress heavy and opaque occluding rain streaks, but also large semi-transparent regional fluctuations and distortions.",

In this paper, we formulate the visual dialog tasks as graph structure learning tasks. To tackle the problem, we propose Sparse Graph Learning Networks (SGLNs) consisting of a multimodal node embedding module and a sparse graph learning module. The proposed model explicitly learn sparse dialog structures by incorporating binary and score edges, leveraging a new structural loss function. Then, it finally outputs the answer, updating each node via a message passing framework. As a result, the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on the VisDial v1.0 dataset, only using 10.95 of the dialog history, as well as improves interpretability compared to baseline methods.",

Due to these features, for each rate vector achieved by network coding, there is always a routing scheme such that it achieves the same rate vector, and the traffic transmitted through the network is exactly the information transmitted over the cut-sets between the sources and the sinks in the corresponding network coding scheme.

Extending the methods in , we show that the functional EM algorithm recovers the true mean function of the counting process.

We prove strong consistency of the M-step, thus giving strong consistency guarantees for the finite sample EM algorithm.

That new notion of nationhood engendered a deep interest in the classical past culminating in the ideas of the Neoplatonist philosopher Gemistus Pletho, who abandoned Christianity.

These were further strengthened following the fall of the Empire of Trebizond in 1461, after which and until the second Russo-Turkish War of 1828-29 hundreds of thousands of Pontic Greeks fled or migrated from the Pontic Alps and Armenian Highlands to southern Russia and the Russian South Caucasus (see also Greeks in Russia, Greeks in Armenia, Greeks in Georgia, and Caucasian Greeks).",

However, nonlinear and nonconvex heating flow imposes significant challenges on finding qualified solutions efficiently. Most existing methods rely on constant flow assumptions to derive a linear heating flow model, sacrificing optimality for computational simplicity. This paper proposes a novel convex combined heat and power dispatch model based on model simplification and constraint relaxation, which improves solution quality and avoids assumptions on operating regimes of district heating systems. To alleviate mathematical complexity introduced by the commonly used node method, a simplified thermal dynamic model is proposed to capture temperature changes in networked pipelines. Conic and polyhedral relaxations are then applied to convexify the original problems with bilinear and quadratic equality constraints. Furthermore, an adaptive solution algorithm is proposed to successively reduce relaxation gaps based on dynamic bivariate partitioning, improving solution optimality with desirable computational efficiency. The proposed method is verified on a 33-bus electric power system integrated with a 30-node district heating system and compared to nonlinear programming solvers and constant-flow-based solutions.",

This interpretation process is labor intensive and can produce different results depending on the stratigrapher who performs the analysis. To relieve stratigrapher's workload and to produce more consistent results, we have developed a novel methodology to automate this process using various computational intelligence techniques.

The output signals of LSE Precoders are limited to be chosen from a predefined set which let these precoders address several constraints such as peak power limitation, constant envelope transmission and discrete constellations. We study the large-system performance of these precoders via the replica method from statistical physics, and derive a closed-form expression for the asymptotic distortion. Our results demonstrate that an LSE precoder with the output peak-to-average power ratio of 3 dB can track the performance of the Regularized Zero Forcing (RZF) precoder closely. As the peak-to-average power ratio reduces to one, the constant envelope precoder is recovered. The investigations depict that the performance of the RZF precoder is achieved by the constant envelope precoder with 20 of more transmit antennas. For M -PSK constellations, our analysis gives a lower-bound on the asymptotic distortion which is tight for moderate antenna-to-user ratios and deviates as the ratio grows. We improve this bound by deriving the replica solution under one-step of replica symmetry breaking. Our numerical investigations for this case show that the bound is tight for antenna-to-user ratios less than 5 .",

This paper presents an approach that allows ABMs to be dynamically optimised. Through a combination of parameter calibration and data assimilation (DA), the accuracy of model-based predictions using ABM in real time is increased. We use the exemplar of a bus route system to explore these methods. The bus route ABMs developed in this research are examples of ABMs that can be dynamically optimised by a combination of parameter calibration and DA.

In contrast to previous methods tending to reduce the quantization error for training BNN structures, we argue that the binarized convolution process owns an increasing linearity towards the target of minimizing such error, which in turn hampers BNN's discriminative ability. In this paper, we re-investigate and tune proper non-linear modules to fix that contradiction, leading to a strong baseline which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet dataset in terms of accuracy and training efficiency. To go further, we find that the proposed BNN model still has much potential to be compressed by making a better use of the efficient binary operations, without losing accuracy. In addition, the limited capacity of the BNN model can also be increased with the help of group execution. Based on these insights, we are able to improve the baseline with an additional 4 5 top-1 accuracy gain even with less computational cost. Our code will be made public at .",

In this paper, we present a more challenging environment for testing the emergence of communication from raw pixels, where training using policy gradient fails. We propose a new model and training algorithm, that utilizes the structure of a learned representation space to produce more consistent speakers at the initial phases of training, which stabilizes learning.

Classifiers based on a single shapelet are not sufficiently strong for certain applications. Additionally, previous work with multiple shapelets has heuristically chosen some of the instances as shapelets with no theoretical guarantee of its generalization ability. Our formulation provides a richer class of the final classifiers based on infinitely many shapelets. We provide an efficient algorithm for the new formulation, in addition to generalization bound.

We implement KIST, simulate it in a 2,000-relay private Tor network using Shadow, deploy it on a Tor relay running in the public Tor network, and measure its performance impact. Confirming the results reported in prior research, we find that KIST reduces kernel outbound queuing times for relays and download times for low-volume or bursty clients. We also find that client and relay performance with KIST increases as network load and packet loss rates increase, although the effects of packet loss on KIST were overlooked in past work.

In particular, one stage of a local voting-based scheme (game) for identifying a target node is developed using a Bayesian game. In this context, incentives are offered in expected utilities of nodes in order to promote cooperation in the network. The proposed model is then analyzed to obtain equilibrium points, ensuring that no node can improve its utility by changing its strategy. Finally, the behavior of malicious and benign nodes is studied by extensive simulation results. Specifically, it is shown how the existing uncertainties and the designed incentives impact the strategies of the players and, consequently, the correct target-node identification.",

In this paper we propose a simple QE framework based on cross-lingual transformers, and we use it to implement and evaluate two different neural architectures. Our evaluation shows that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results outperforming current open-source quality estimation frameworks when trained on datasets from WMT. In addition, the framework proves very useful in transfer learning settings, especially when dealing with low-resourced languages, allowing us to obtain very competitive results.",

However, since the similarity label is less informative than the class label, it is more likely to be noisy. Deep neural networks can easily remember noisy data, leading to overfitting in classification. In this paper, we propose a method for learning from only noisy-similarity-labeled data. Specifically, to model the noise, we employ a noise transition matrix to bridge the class-posterior probability between clean and noisy data. We further estimate the transition matrix from only noisy data and build a novel learning system to learn a classifier which can assign noise-free class labels for instances. Moreover, we theoretically justify how our proposed method generalizes for learning classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art method on benchmark-simulated and real-world noisy-label datasets.",

Specifically, the method targets the situation where, due to pseudo-measurement uncertainty, it is advantageous to run the state estimation solver potentially thousands of times over sampled input perturbations in order to compute probabilistic bounds on the underlying system state. This routine, termed the Accelerated Probabilistic State Estimator (APSE), efficiently searches for the solutions of sequential state estimation problems in a low dimensional subspace with a reduced order model (ROM). When a sufficiently accurate solution is not found, the APSE reverts to a conventional QR factorization-based Gauss-Newton solver. It then uses the resulting solution to preform a simple basis expansion of the low-dimensional subspace, thus improving the reduced model solver. Simulated test results, collected from the unbalanced three-phase 8500-node distribution grid, show the resulting algorithm to be almost an order of magnitude faster than a comparable full-order Gauss-Newton solver and thus potentially fast enough for real-time use.",

Different from the mainstream audio-visual approaches which usually require simultaneous visual streams as additional input, e.g. the corresponding lip movement sequences, in our approach we propose the novel use of a single face profile of the target speaker to separate expected clean speech. We exploit the fact that the image of a face contains information about the person's speech sound. Compared to using a simultaneous visual sequence, a face image is easier to obtain by pre-enrollment or on websites, which enables the system to generalize to devices without cameras. To this end, we incorporate face embeddings extracted from a pretrained model for face recognition into the speech separation, which guide the system in predicting a target speaker mask in the time-frequency domain. The experimental results show that a pre-enrolled face image is able to benefit separating expected speech signals. Additionally, face information is complementary to voice reference and we show that further improvement can be achieved when combing both face and voice embeddings 1 footnote 1 1 footnote 1 Web demo:",

First, in order to avoid the unwinding phenomenon when the system states are restricted to the switching surface, a novel switching function is constructed by hyperbolic sine functions such that the switching surface contains two equilibriums. Then, a sliding mode attitude maneuver controller is designed based on the constructed switching function to ensure the robustness of the closed-loop attitude maneuver control system to disturbance. Another important feature of the developed attitude control law is that a dynamic parameter is introduced to guarantee the anti-unwinding performance before the system states reach the switching surface. The simulation results demonstrate that the unwinding problem is settled during attitude maneuver for rigid spacecraft by adopting the newly constructed switching function and proposed attitude control scheme.",

By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of Queen Louise.

We prove that Expectigrad cannot diverge on every instance of the optimization problem known to cause Adam to diverge. We also establish a regret bound in the general stochastic nonconvex setting that suggests Expectigrad is less susceptible to gradient variance than existing methods are.

Subjects with inner ear malformations, especially Mondini's dysplasia, need to be carefully evaluated pre-operatively to reduce or eliminate any anatomical conditions which may predispose to meningitis. In children with an auditory brainstem implant and suspected ear malformation, we recommend pre-operative radiological investigation to look for the 'bulging oval window' sign. When radiological signs are positive, bilateral exploratory tympanotomy should be performed to detect any undiagnosed anatomical stapes footplate defects, which may predispose to bacterial meningitis.",

Therefore, the problem can be solved using multi-fidelity hierarchical optimistic optimization (MFHOO). Bandit algorithms, and MFHOO in particular, give (regret) bounds on the sample efficiency which rely on the smoothness and the near-optimality dimension of the objective function, and are a new addition to the existing types of bounds in the SMC literature. We present a new SMC tool - HooVer - built on these principles and our experiments suggest that: Compared with exact probabilistic model checking tools like Storm, HooVer scales better; compared with the statistical model checking tool PlasmaLab, HooVer can require much less data to achieve comparable results.",

Instead, they use non-sticky silk that acts as alarm threads: \"RED-ALERT!

Once it feels the vibration, it knows the relative size and direction of the prey item (this prevents it from, say, being tricked by a blowing leave or potentially trying to tackle something far larger and more dangerous than itself). Also, spiders sometimes DO get stuck in their own webs! This is, however, exceptionally rare.

Recently, several highly flexible and scalable variational inference procedures based on the idea of particle optimization have been proposed. These methods directly optimize a set of particles to approximate the target posterior. However, their application to BNNs often yields sub-optimal performance, as they have a particular failure mode on over-parameterized models. In this paper, we propose to solve this issue by performing particle optimization directly in the space of regression functions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our method successfully overcomes this issue, and outperforms strong baselines in a variety of tasks including prediction, defense against adversarial examples, and reinforcement learning.",

Here we introduce a powerful new approach for learning generative models over graphs, which can capture both their structure and attributes. Our approach uses graph neural networks to express probabilistic dependencies among a graph's nodes and edges, and can, in principle, learn distributions over any arbitrary graph. In a series of experiments our results show that once trained, our models can generate good quality samples of both synthetic graphs as well as real molecular graphs, both unconditionally and conditioned on data. Compared to baselines that do not use graph-structured representations, our models often perform far better. We also explore key challenges of learning generative models of graphs, such as how to handle symmetries and ordering of elements during the graph generation process, and offer possible solutions.

However, the fronthaul links connecting each AP to the cloud introduce delays and cause outdated Channel State Information (CSI). By contrast, FogRAN enables lower latencies and better CSI qualities, at the cost of local optimization. To alleviate these issues, we propose a hybrid algorithm exploiting both the centralized feature of the cloud for globally-optimized pre-scheduling using outdated CSIs and the distributed nature of FogRAN for accurate beamforming with high quality CSIs. The centralized phase enables to consider the interference patterns over the global network, while the distributed phase allows for latency reduction.

Both remain far below the peak of housing market activity, but signal an assumption of imminent rate rises despite market turmoil in recent days. The economic situation in China created a shock across world markets and some analysts suggested this could delay a rise in the Bank rate in the UK. The governor of the Bank of England was more circumspect in a recent speech and has hinted that a rate rise could be seen next year. Homeowners have been increasingly signing up to mortgage deals, especially by remortgaging, in anticipation of a rate rise.

Our multifactorial statistical model, which is person-independent, obtains the accuracy score of 72.28 for a 2-class daily stress recognition problem.

Under the hypothesis that the increase of elastin resulted from the mechanical stimulus from solid-state LCs, MNLO images were subjected to FEA to simulate the displacement according to the expanding magnitude of the vessel during cardiac cycles. We found that microscale focal stress was increased specifically around the LCs. These FEA results corresponded with the increase of elastin observed by TPEF.

Of the observed partial haemocyanin sequence, residue 2545 formed a close link between the FU g surface and the active centre, suggesting a role as allosteric binding site. The prevalence of methionine at this site in polar octopods, implies regulation of oxygen affinity via increased sensitivity to allosteric metal binding.

CCA and to a lesser extent GCCA have been studied from the statistical and algorithmic points of view, but not as much from the standpoint of linear algebra. This paper offers a fresh algebraic perspective of GCCA based on a (bi linear generative model that naturally captures its essence. It is shown that from a linear algebra point of view, GCCA is tantamount to subspace intersection; and conditions under which the common subspace of the different views is identifiable are provided. A novel GCCA algorithm is proposed based on subspace intersection, which scales up to handle large GCCA tasks. Synthetic as well as real data experiments are provided to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "text": "This paper analyzes the communication between two energy harvesting wireless sensor nodes. The nodes use automatic repeat request and forward error correction mechanism for the error control. The random nature of available energy and arrivals of harvested energy may induces interruption to the signal sampling and decoding operations. We propose a selective sampling scheme where the length of the transmitted packet to be sampled depends on the available energy at the receiver. The receiver performs the decoding when complete samples of the packet are available. The selective sampling information bits are piggybacked on the automatic repeat request messages for the transmitter use. This way, the receiver node manages more efficiently its energy use. Besides, we present the partially observable Markov decision process formulation, which minimizes the long-term average pairwise error probability and optimizes the transmit power. Optimal and suboptimal power assignment strategies are introduced for retransmissions, which are adapted to the selective sampling and channel state information. With finite battery size and fixed power assignment policy, an analytical expression for the average is derived. Numerical simulations show the performance gain of the proposed scheme with power assignment strategy over the conventional scheme.",

        "text": "This paper focuses on structured-output learning using deep neural networks for 3D human pose estimation from monocular images. Our network takes an image and 3D pose as inputs and outputs a score value, which is high when the image-pose pair matches and low otherwise. The network structure consists of a convolutional neural network for image feature extraction, followed by two sub-networks for transforming the image features and pose into a joint embedding. The score function is then the dot-product between the image and pose embeddings. The image-pose embedding and score function are jointly trained using a maximum-margin cost function. Our proposed framework can be interpreted as a special form of structured support vector machines where the joint feature space is discriminatively learned using deep neural networks. We test our framework on the Human3.6m dataset and obtain state-of-the-art results compared to other recent methods. Finally, we present visualizations of the image-pose embedding space, demonstrating the network has learned a high-level embedding of body-orientation and pose-configuration.",

We demonstrate that e-Learning with CEVL is effective in increasing both the confidence and accuracy of SFU grading of pediatric HN.

The key idea is to utilize a particular repetitive pattern of placing the dataset (thus a particular repetitive pattern of intermediate computations), in order to provide coding opportunities at both the users and the access point, which reduce the required uplink communication bandwidth from users to access point and the downlink communication bandwidth from access point to users by factors that grow linearly with the number of users.

Learning the force-torque dynamics is challenging because of the ambiguity of the low-dimensional 6-d force signal and the requirement of excessive training data. To tackle these problems, we propose a multi-pose force-torque state representation, based on which a dynamics model is learned with the data generated in a sample-efficient offline fashion. In addition, by training the dynamics model with peg-and-holes of various shapes, scales, and elasticities, the model could quickly transfer to new peg-and-holes after a small number of trials. Extensive experiments show that our dynamics model could adapt to unseen peg-and-holes with 70 fewer samples required compared to learning from scratch. Along with the learned dynamics, model predictive control and model-based reinforcement learning policies achieve over 80 insertion success rate. Our video is available at .",

A major contribution of the paper is to develop for the first time a class of (inexact) best-response-like algorithms with provable convergence, where a suitably convexified version of the original DC program is iteratively solved. The main feature of the proposed successive convex approximation method is its decomposability structure across the users, which leads naturally to distributed algorithms in the primal andor dual domain. The proposed framework is applicable to a variety of multiuser DC problems in different areas, ranging from signal processing, to communications and networking. As a case study, in the second part of the paper we focus on two examples, namely: i) a novel resource allocation problem in the emerging area of cooperative physical layer security; ii) and the renowned sum-rate maximization of MIMO Cognitive Radio networks. Our contribution in this context is to devise a class of easy-to-implement distributed algorithms with provable convergence to stationary solution of such problems. Numerical results show that the proposed distributed schemes reach performance close to (and sometimes better than) that of centralized methods.",

The links of the graph connect pixels in different images and describe the proximity between pixels in the 3D space. These connections are dependent on the geometry of the scene and provide the right amount of information that is necessary for coding and reconstructing multiple views. This multiview image representation is very compact and adapts the transmitted geometry information as a function of the complexity of the prediction performed at the decoder side. To achieve this, our GBR adapts the accuracy of the geometry representation, in contrast with depth coding, which directly compresses with losses the original geometry signal. We present the principles of this graph-based representation (GBR) and we build a complete prototype coding scheme for multiview images. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of this new representation as compared to a depth-based approach. GBR can achieve a gain of 2 dB in reconstructed quality over depth-based schemes operating at similar rates.",

To exploit the advantages of the two-part framework, we propose a Noisy-Sudocodes algorithm that performs two-part reconstruction of sparse signals in the presence of measurement noise. Specifically, we design a fast algorithm for Part 1 of Noisy-Sudocodes that identifies the zero coefficients of the input signal from its noisy measurements.

Jaded beyond recognition after living under the sun and knowing the history of my kind, how persistently cruel, heartless, stupid, and utterly pointless all the pain and suffering has always been, I don't see why I should wish to see it prosper much further. I believe the Earth and its other inhabitants would be far better off without man and the barbarism his consciousness brings about. I've also always been baffled by people who say people are in general good. With how destructive man has been to the earth, and to himself, through war, industrialization, pollution, etc., I fail to see how someone can arrive at this conclusion. I'm not trolling. Please try and persuade me why I should believe in humans.",

A question we ask is whether one can leverage abundant unlabeled texts to improve syntactic parsers, beyond just using the texts to obtain more generalisable lexical features (i.e. beyond word embeddings). To this end, we propose a novel latent-variable generative model for semi-supervised syntactic dependency parsing. As exact inference is intractable, we introduce a differentiable relaxation to obtain approximate samples and compute gradients with respect to the parser parameters. Our method (Differentiable Perturb-and-Parse) relies on differentiable dynamic programming over stochastically perturbed arc weights.

This discretization, along with Parseval's identity lead to a linear programming formulation for minimizing a weighted sum of total harmonic distortions of the input current and the output voltages.

Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process. The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.:18.2",

However, due to non-simultaneous measurements and unavoidable estimation error, bias always exists and key disagreement occurs. In this paper, performance analysis and improvements for key generation exploiting imperfect channel statement information (CSI) is studied. Firstly, the closed-form expression for key disagreement rate (KDR) is derived to evaluate the key mismatch caused by time delay and estimation error. Secondly, the energy efficiency involving power allocation between key generation and private data transmission is presented. After that, a neural network based prediction (NNBP) algorithm is proposed to improve the key consistency. Simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and show that NNBP achieves significant improvements. And it's interesting to find that NNBP algorithm achieves a higher performance gain in low signal-to-noise ration (SNR) and high delay condition, which is different from other methods, like guard band based quantizer (GBBQ).",

This distorts the system dynamics, lowers the quality of the results, and can lead to instability. By using power bonds to realize simulator coupling, the Energy-Conservation-based Co-Simulation method (ECCO) [Sadjina et al . 2016] exploits these concepts to define non-iterative global error estimation and adaptive step size control relying on coupling variable data alone. Following similar argumentation, the Nearly Energy Preserving Coupling Element (NEPCE) [Benedikt et al . 2013] uses corrections to the simulator inputs to approximately ensure energy conservation. Here, we discuss a modification to NEPCE for when direct feed-through is present in one of the coupled simulators. We further demonstrate how accuracy and efficiency in non-iterative co-simulations are substantially enhanced when combining NEPCE with ECCO's adaptive step size controller. A quarter car model with linear and nonlinear damping characteristics serves as a co-simulation benchmark, and we observe reductions of the coupling errors of up to 98 utilizing the concepts discussed here.",

Here we extend the concept of NF for static stochastic scenarios. We assume that the robot, the obstacles and the workspace geometries are known discs, while their positions are random variables. We define a Probability NF (PNF) by introducing an additional permitted collision probability , which limits the risks (to a set value) during robot motion. We apply the Minkowski sum for the continuous case when considering the geometries with the Probability Density Functions (PDF). The PDF for collision is therefore the normalized convolution of the robot geometry, the obstacles geometries and their locations' PDFs.

The interior was painted by Luigi Gregori, an Italian painter invited by Fr. Sorin to be artist in residence. The Basilica also features a bell tower with a carillon. Inside the church there are also sculptures by Ivan Mestrovic. The Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, which was built in 1896, is a replica of the original in Lourdes, France. It is very popular among students and alumni as a place of prayer and meditation, and it is considered one of the most beloved spots on campus.",

A network of transmitters, which already have cryptographically secured channels between them, cooperate to exchange a secret key with a new receiver at a random location, in the presence of passive eavesdroppers at unknown locations. Two spatial point processes: homogeneous Poisson process and independent uniformly distributed points are used for the spatial distributions of transmitters and eavesdroppers. We analyse the impact of the number of cooperating transmitters and the number of eavesdroppers on the area fraction where secure communication is possible. Upper bounds on the probability of existence of positive secrecy between the cooperating transmitters and the receiver are derived. The closeness of the upper bounds to the real value is then estimated by means of numerical simulations. Simulations also indicate that a deterministic spatial distribution for the transmitters e.g. hexagonal and square lattices, increases the probability of existence of positive secrecy capacity compared to the random spatial distributions. For the same number of friendly nodes, cooperative transmitting provides a dramatically larger secrecy region than cooperative jamming and cooperative relaying.",

I feel that even though they may psychologically identify with the other gender, the fact is they are still physically their own gender. For example, a male psychologically identifying as a female pre-op is still a male which makes a male attracted to a male and therefore gay.

While performing with Emmy, Madonna recorded about 12-14 songs which resemble the punk rock of that period. Her early rock roots also can be found on the demo album Pre-Madonna. Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that with her self-titled debut album, Madonna began her career as a disco diva, in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of. In the beginning of the '80's, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop, and according to Erlewine, Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music. The album's songs reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, including a strong dance-based idiom, catchy hooks, highly polished arrangements and Madonna's own vocal style. Her second album, Like a Virgin (1984), foreshadowed several trends in her later works. It contained references to classical works (pizzicato synthesizer line that opens \"Angel; potential negative reaction from social groups Dress You Up\" was blacklisted by the Parents Music Resource Center); and retro styles Shoo-Bee-Doo,\" Madonna's homage to Motown).",

The proposed framework combines adjacency-graphs and kernel spectral clustering based graphs (KSC-graphs) according to a new definition named affinity nodes of multi-scale superpixels. These affinity nodes are selected based on a better affiliation of superpixels, namely subspace-preserving representation which is generated by sparse subspace clustering based on subspace pursuit. Then a KSC-graph is built via a novel kernel spectral clustering to explore the nonlinear relationships among these affinity nodes. Moreover, an adjacency-graph at each scale is constructed, which is further used to update the proposed KSC-graph at affinity nodes. The fusion graph is built across different scales, and it is partitioned to obtain final segmentation result. Experimental results on the Berkeley segmentation dataset and Microsoft Research Cambridge dataset show the superiority of our framework in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.

Compare with traditional storage systems, CSSs have lots of advantages, such as higher capacity, lower cost, and easier scalability. However, they suffer from the main shortcoming of high complexity. To ensure the reliability of CSSs, the correctness of management programs should be proven. Therefore, a verification framework based on Separation Logic (SL) is proposed to prove the correctness of management programs in Block-based Cloud Storage Systems (BCSSs), which is the most popular CSSs. The main contributions are as follows. (1) Two-tier heap structure is constructed as the type of storage units in BCSSs. All the operations to BCSSs are based on the structure. (2) Assertion pairs are defined to describe the properties for the two-tier structure. The fact that the two components of a pair effect each other leads lots of interesting properties. (3) A proof system with Hoare-style specification rules is proposed to reason about the BCSSs. The results show that the correctness of BCSSs can be verified precisely and flexibly.",

Dyna is a planning paradigm that naturally interleaves learning and planning, by simulating one-step experience to update the action-value function. This elegant planning strategy has been mostly explored in the tabular setting. The aim of this paper is to revisit sample-based planning, in stochastic and continuous domains with learned models. We first highlight the flexibility afforded by a model over Experience Replay (ER). Replay-based methods can be seen as stochastic planning methods that repeatedly sample from a buffer of recent agent-environment interactions and perform updates to improve data efficiency. We show that a model, as opposed to a replay buffer, is particularly useful for specifying which states to sample from during planning, such as predecessor states that propagate information in reverse from a state more quickly. We introduce a semi-parametric model learning approach, called Reweighted Experience Models (REMs), that makes it simple to sample next states or predecessors. We demonstrate that REM-Dyna exhibits similar advantages over replay-based methods in learning in continuous state problems, and that the performance gap grows when moving to stochastic domains, of increasing size.",

We make use of an input-output decomposition of a given specification described as a CNF formula, by alternatingly analyzing the separate input and output components. We exploit well-defined properties of these components to ultimately synthesize a solution for the entire specification. We first provide a theoretical result that, for input components with specific structures, synthesis for CNF formulas via this framework can be performed more efficiently than in the general case.

These programming models rely on runtime systems, and their goal is to improve application performance by properly scheduling application tasks to cores. Additionally, these runtime systems offer policies to cope with application phases that lack in parallelism to fill all cores. However, these policies are usually static and favor either performance or energy efficiency. In this paper, we have extended a task-based runtime system with a lightweight monitoring and prediction infrastructure that dynamically predicts the optimal number of cores required for each application phase, thus improving both performance and energy efficiency. Through the execution of several benchmarks in multi-many-core systems, we show that our prediction-based policies have competitive performance while improving energy efficiency when compared to state of the art policies.",

Possibly because of European diseases devastating the Indian tribes, which would have left a population vacuum, and also from expanding European settlement in the north, the Cherokee moved south from the area now called Virginia.

Studying the impact of the lockdown, trough the lens of social media, offers an unprecedented opportunity for analyzing the susceptibility and the resilience of circadian rhythms to large-scale exogenous shocks. In this context, we address two interconnected research questions: Can variations of online activity cycles provide information on the impact of lockdown on human activities? How do online circadian rhythms react to such a disruption? Data: We base our research on the analysis and comparison of two independent databases about the French cyberspace: a fine-grained temporal record of YouTube videos and a large collection of Tweets on Covid-19. Findings: In both datasets we observe a reshaping of the circadian rhythms with a substantial increase of night activity during the lockdown. The analysis of the videos and tweets published during lockdown shows a general decrease in emotional contents and a shift from themes like work and money to themes like death and safety. However, the daily patterns of emotions remain mostly unchanged, thereby suggesting that emotional cycles are resilient to exogenous shocks.",

Physicists have been searching for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) for decades, but experiments have so far returned no results. Dark matter may still be composed of WIMPs, but it is becoming more likely that it is made of axions. Axions are a good candidate as its invisible presence explains why the universe acts heavier than it looks, and it also explains why the two fundamental forces that shape atomic nuclei follow different rulebooks. The axion is somewhat similar to the photon, but with a hint of mass. Theoretically, axions aren't completely undetectable as they should occasionally transform into two photons. Experiments are currently underway to detect these particles.",

We consider the station (STA) -access point (AP) association and airtime control for virtualized 802.11 networks to provide service customization and fairness across multiple internet service providers (ISPs) sharing the common physical infrastructure and network capacity. More specifically, an optimization problem is formulated on the STAs' transmission probabilities to maximize the overall network throughput, while providing airtime usage guarantees for the ISPs. Subsequently, an algorithm to reach the optimal solution is developed by applying monomial approximation and geometric programming iteratively. Based on the proposed three-dimensional Markov-chain model of the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) protocol, the detailed implementation of the optimal transmission probability is also discussed. The accuracy of the proposed Markov-chain model and the performance of the developed association and airtime control scheme are evaluated through numerical results.",

Instead of continuing to defend the heights, by the close of battle after dusk he retreated to the south. The German casualties were relatively high due to the advance and the effectiveness of the chassepot rifle.

Moreover, we extend the results to constrained distributed optimization, where it is shown that the problem is solved by just adding one more feedback loop of a passive system to the solution of the unconstrained ones.

Major challenges in the control of the HPV include a nonlinear and large-scale model, nonsmoothness in the power-production functions, and a globally coupled cost function that prevents distributed schemes to be applied directly.

To investigate a segmental implication in the neuropathic pain induced by dopamine depletion, the expression of the isoform gamma of the protein kinase C (PKCg) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 12 (pERK12) was explored in the medullary dorsal horn (MDH). There was a high increase in PKCg expression in the III and IIi laminae of the MDH of lesioned-animals compared to shams. pERK12 expression was also significantly high in the ipsilateral MDH of lesioned rats in response to non-noxious tactile stimulus of the orofacial region. Since pERK12 is expressed only in response to nociceptive stimuli in the dorsal spinal horn, the current study demonstrates that non-noxious stimuli evoke allodynic response. Intraperitoneal and intracisternal administrations of bromocriptine, a dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) agonist, significantly decreased DMA compared to control rats injected with saline. These data demonstrate for the first time that nigrostriatal dopaminergic depletion produces trigeminal neuropathic pain that at least involves a segmental mechanism.

This paper introduces a robust version of the classical KLD, defined as the KLD from a distribution to the L ' e vy ball of a known distribution. This robust KLD is shown to be continuous in the underlying distribution function with respect to the weak convergence. The continuity property enables the development of a universal hypothesis test for continuous observations that is shown to be asymptotically optimal for continuous distributions in the same sense as that of the Hoeffding's test for discrete distributions.",

The original practice was called \"redlining,\" where minorities were placed into certain neighborhoods (denoted by 'red lines' on the map), which then got the worst services, infrastructure, and etc. Banks could deny business loans and mortgages and all that just by looking at someone's address, and more. Having terrible services (including banking or financial services) is a great recipe for multi-generational poverty. 2 - While services are important, there's also the idea of role models. Part (alot?) of 'white privilege' is a learned behavior. The assumption that \"you can get what you ask for, so what's the harm in asking?\" Other less privileges groups might have different sets of assumptions about the possible harm in asking for someone. In addition there are a number of \"soft skills\" that can help with getting and keeping a job that people growing up in neighborhoods with a lot of poverty might not be able to learn. By mixing neighborhoods by income, you make it harder to discriminate and provide immediate role models for what 'success' looks like.",

We show that a wide variety of previous methods, including denoising, contractive, and sparse autoencoders, as well as dropout can be interpreted using this framework. This noise injection framework reaps practical benefits by providing a unified strategy to develop new internal representations by designing the nature of the injected noise. We show that noisy autoencoders outperform denoising autoencoders at the very task of denoising, and are competitive with other single-layer techniques on MNIST, and CIFAR-10.

We propose a novel word-level prediction task to investigate how explanations selectively reuse, or echo , information from what is being explained (henceforth, explanandum). We develop features to capture the properties of a word in the explanandum, and show that our proposed features not only have relatively strong predictive power on the echoing of a word in an explanation, but also enhance neural methods of generating explanations. In particular, while the non-contextual properties of a word itself are more valuable for stopwords, the interaction between the constituent parts of an explanandum is crucial in predicting the echoing of content words.

For example, although nouns are generally less likely to be echoed, subjects and objects can, depending on their source, be more likely to be echoed in the explanations.",

To overcome this drawback, a new latent nuclear norm equipped with a more balanced unfolding scheme is defined for low-rank regularizer. Moreover, the new latent nuclear norm together with the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm is developed as an efficient completion method by utilizing the sparsity structure of observed tensor. Specifically, both FW linear subproblem and line search only need to access the observed entries, by which we can instead maintain the sparse tensors and a set of small basis matrices during iteration. Most operations are based on sparse tensors, and the closed-form solution of FW linear subproblem can be obtained from rank-one SVD. We theoretically analyze the space-complexity and time-complexity of the proposed method, and show that it is much more efficient over other norm-based completion methods for higher-order tensors. Extensive experimental results of visual-data inpainting demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance at smaller costs of time and space, which is very meaningful for the memory-limited equipment in practical applications.",

Considering the multiple MBs under the non-positive joint probability distribution, we explore the relationships between common causal variables and equivalent information phenomenon, and find that the solutions are influenced by equivalent information following different mechanisms with or without existence of label causality. Analyzing these mechanisms, we provide the theoretical property of common causal variables, based on which the discovery and distinguishing algorithm is designed to identify these two types of variables. Similar to single-label problem, causal variables for multiple labels also have extensive application prospects. To demonstrate this, we apply the proposed causal mechanism to multi-label feature selection and present an interpretable algorithm, which is proved to achieve the minimal redundancy and the maximum relevance.

The second, simulation-based, algorithm is developed to overcome the shortcoming of the first algorithm in terms of generating the equilibrium set efficiently and then making policy-relevant predictions based on the set. The second algorithm will be usefully applied to a real-world case study, which draws on the current crisis between North Korea and certain key players including the US and China.",

Samurai films and westerns share a number of similarities and the two have influenced each other over the years. One of Japan's most renowned directors, Akira Kurosawa, greatly influenced the samurai aspect in western film-making.[citation needed] George Lucas' Star Wars series incorporated many aspects from the Seven Samurai film. One example is that in the Japanese film, seven samurai warriors are hired by local farmers to protect their land from being overrun by bandits; In George Lucas' Star Wars: A New Hope, a similar situation arises. Kurosawa was inspired by the works of director John Ford and in turn Kurosawa's works have been remade into westerns such as The Seven Samurai into The Magnificent Seven and Yojimbo into A Fistful of Dollars. There is also a 26 episode anime adaptation (Samurai 7) of The Seven Samurai. Along with film, literature containing samurai influences are seen as well.",

Repeat that with a few million dust particles, and you've got a cloud of water droplets.

While small to mid-sized convex QCQPs can be solved efficiently by interior-point algorithms, large-scale problems pose significant challenges to traditional centralized algorithms, since the exploding volume of data may overwhelm a single computing unit. In this paper, we propose a decomposition method for general non-separable, large-scale convex QCQPs, using the idea of predictor-corrector proximal primal-dual update with an adaptive step size. The algorithm enables distributed storage of data as well as distributed computing. We both establish convergence of the algorithm to a global optimum and test the algorithm on a computer cluster with multiple threads. The numerical test is done on data sets of different scales using Message Passing Interface, and the results show that our algorithm exhibits favourable scalability for large-scale data even when CPLEX fails to provide a solution due to memory limits.",

This could help scaling detection models to larger number of classes with fewer annotations. Motivated by this, we study how a detection model trained on a small set of source classes can provide proposals that generalize to unseen classes. We systematically study the properties of the dataset - visual diversity and label space granularity - required for good generalization. We show the trade-off between using fine-grained labels and coarse labels. We introduce the idea of prototypical classes: a set of sufficient and necessary classes required to train a detection model to obtain generalized proposals in a more data-efficient way. On the Open Images V4 dataset, we show that only 25 of the classes can be selected to form such a prototypical set. The resulting proposals from a model trained with these classes is only 4.3 worse than using all the classes, in terms of average recall (AR). We also demonstrate that Faster R-CNN model leads to better generalization of proposals compared to a single-stage network like RetinaNet.",

Concretely, an HA module embedded in the HANet captures context information from neighbors of multiple levels, where these neighbors are extracted from the high-order graph. In the high-order graph, there will be an edge between two nodes only if the correlation between them is high enough, which naturally reduces the noisy attention information caused by the inter-class indistinction. The proposed HA module is robust to the variance of input and can be flexibly inserted into the existing convolution neural networks.

        "text": "Resource allocation in wireless networks, such as device-to-device (D2D) communications, is usually formulated as mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems, which are generally NP-hard and difficult to get the optimal solutions. Traditional methods to solve these MINLP problems are all based on mathematical optimization techniques, such as the branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that converges slowly and has forbidding complexity for real-time implementation. Therefore, machine leaning (ML) has been used recently to address the MINLP problems in wireless communications. In this paper, we use imitation learning method to accelerate the BB algorithm. With invariant problem-independent features and appropriate problem-dependent feature selection for D2D communications, a good auxiliary prune policy can be learned in a supervised manner to speed up the most time-consuming branch process of the BB algorithm. Moreover, we develop a mixed training strategy to further reinforce the generalization ability and a deep neural network (DNN) with a novel loss function to achieve better dynamic control over optimality and computational complexity. Extensive simulation demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve good optimality and reduce computational complexity simultaneously.",

At the same time, composition of embeddings has been a main focus within the field of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) whose goal is to predict relations between entities (typically from knowledge base triples). In this article, we show that previous work on relation prediction between texts implicitly uses compositions from baseline SRL models. We show that such compositions are not expressive enough for several tasks (e.g. natural language inference). We build on recent SRL models to address textual relational problems, showing that they are more expressive, and can alleviate issues from simpler compositions.

Most existing techniques, however, perform this coding step directly in image feature space, where the distributions of the different classes are typically entangled. In contrast, here, we study the problem of performing coding in a high-dimensional Hilbert space, where the classes are expected to be more easily separable. To this end, we introduce a general coding formulation that englobes the most popular techniques, such as bag of words, sparse coding and locality-based coding, and show how this formulation and its special cases can be kernelized. Importantly, we address several aspects of learning in our general formulation, such as kernel learning, dictionary learning and supervised kernel coding. Our experimental evaluation on several visual recognition tasks demonstrates the benefits of performing coding in Hilbert space, and in particular of jointly learning the kernel, the dictionary and the classifier.",

After analyzing the fixed point operator associated with the nonlinear iteration to prove that certain stability and regularity properties hold, we apply the authors' recently constructed theory for Anderson acceleration, which yields a convergence result for the Anderson accelerated Picard iteration for the Boussinesq system. The result shows that the leading term in the residual is improved by the gain in the optimization problem, but at the cost of additional higher order terms that can be significant when the residual is large. We perform numerical tests that illustrate the theory, and show that a 2-stage choice of Anderson depth can be advantageous.

Although results indicated that training with single cues can improve F0 discrimination within more complex sounds in which multiple cues vary, little improvement was seen when large variations in place were present, which suggests a diminishing effect of the training with increased influence of place-pitch. These data imply that although such training techniques may help listeners to follow melody in music, changes in instrument are likely to affect perception of melody. Results of subsequent training with complex sounds in which multiple cues varied were less conclusive and showed no further improvement. Follow-up evaluations with trainees conducted well after training had ceased verified the robustness of the training effect on F0 but not center frequency discrimination.

In this paper, we improve the ABC algorithm to solve binary optimization problems and call it the improved binary Artificial Bee Colony (ibinABC). The proposed method consists of an update mechanism based on fitness values and processing different number of decision variables. Thus, we aim to prevent the ABC algorithm from getting stuck in a local minimum by increasing its exploration ability. We compare the ibinABC algorithm with three variants of the ABC and other meta-heuristic algorithms in the literature. For comparison, we use the well-known OR-Library dataset containing 15 problem instances prepared for the uncapacitated facility location problem. Computational results show that the proposed method is superior to other methods in terms of convergence speed and robustness.

Several attempts aimed at improving the performance of SIM reconstruction algorithm have been reported. However, most of these highlight only one specific aspect of the SIM reconstruction - such as the determination of the illumination pattern phase shift accurately - whereas other key elements - such as determination of modulation factor, estimation of object power spectrum, Wiener filtering frequency components with inclusion of object power spectrum information, translocating and the merging of the overlapping frequency components - are usually glossed over superficially. In addition, most of the work reported lie scattered throughout the literature and a comprehensive review of the theoretical background is found lacking. The purpose of the present work is two-fold: 1) to collect the essential theoretical details of SIM algorithm at one place, thereby making them readily accessible to readers for the first time; and 2) to provide an open source SIM reconstruction code (named OpenSIM), which enables users to interactively vary the code parameters and study it's effect on reconstructed SIM image.",

This model provides a flexible inference system with many levels of targets which is modular and can be used efficiently in situations requiring different levels of results according to complexity.

In this paper, we investigate how to achieve this by resource allocation with predicted time-average rate, which can be obtained from predicted average residual bandwidth after serving real-time traffic and predicted average channel gains of NRT mobile users. We show the connection between the statistics of their prediction errors. We formulate an optimization problem to make a resource allocation plan within a prediction window for NRT users that randomly initiate requests, which aims to fully use residual resources with ensured quality of service (QoS). To show the benefit of knowing the contents to be requested and the request arrival time in advance, we consider two types of NRT services, video on demand and video on reservation. The optimal solution is obtained, and an online policy is developed that can transmit according to the plan after instantaneous channel gains are available. Simulation and numerical results validate our analysis and show a dramatic gain of the proposed method in supporting high arrival rate of NRT requests with given tolerance on QoS.",

In this work we learn association maps between images and captions. We then use a novel objectness criterion to rank the resulting candidate boxes, such that high-ranking boxes have strong gradients along all edges. Thus, we can detect objects beyond a fixed object category vocabulary, if those objects are frequent and distinctive enough.

Due to limited feedback and hence imperfect IA, there are residual interferences across different links and different data streams. As a result, the performance of IA is greatly related to the CSI accuracy (namely number of feedback bits) and the number of data streams (namely transmission mode). In order to improve the performance of IA, it makes sense to optimize the system parameters according to the channel conditions. Motivated by this, we first give a quantitative performance analysis for IA under limited feedback, and derive a closed-form expression for the average transmission rate in terms of feedback bits and transmission mode. By maximizing the average transmission rate, we obtain an adaptive feedback allocation scheme, as well as a dynamic mode selection scheme. Furthermore, through asymptotic analysis, we obtain several clear insights on the system performance, and provide some guidelines on the system design. Finally, simulation results validate our theoretical claims, and show that obvious performance gain can be obtained by adjusting feedback bits dynamically or selecting transmission mode adaptively.",

The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on reason as the primary source of authority and legitimacy, and came to advance ideals such as liberty, progress, tolerance, fraternity, constitutional government and ending the abuses of the church and state. In France, the central doctrines of the Lumieres were individual liberty and religious tolerance, in opposition to the principle of absolute monarchy and the fixed dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church. The Enlightenment was marked by increasing empiricism, scientific rigor, and reductionism, along with increased questioning of religious orthodoxy.",

We then consider the Partial Observation regime wherein only requests for items currently cached are seen by the cache, making it similar to an online learning problem related to the multi-armed bandit problem. We show how approaching this \"caching bandit\" using traditional approaches yields either high complexity or regret, but a simple algorithm design that exploits the structure of the distribution can ensure order optimal regret.

Thus, the method also gives a new algorithm to compute the topology for space algebraic curves. The main advantage of the algorithm, inhering from the local generic method, is that topology computation and approximation for a space curve is directly reduced to the same tasks for two plane curves.

To tackle this task, recent approaches resort to discriminative domain transfer in virtue of pseudo-labels to enforce the class-level distribution alignment across the source and target domains. These methods, however, are vulnerable to the error accumulation and thus incapable of preserving cross-domain category consistency, as the pseudo-labeling accuracy is not guaranteed explicitly. In this paper, we propose the Progressive Feature Alignment Network (PFAN) to align the discriminative features across domains progressively and effectively, via exploiting the intra-class variation in the target domain. To be specific, we first develop an Easy-to-Hard Transfer Strategy (EHTS) and an Adaptive Prototype Alignment (APA) step to train our model iteratively and alternatively. Moreover, upon observing that a good domain adaptation usually requires a non-saturated source classifier, we consider a simple yet efficient way to retard the convergence speed of the source classification loss by further involving a temperature variate into the soft-max function.

Mosaic murals, benches and tabletops are some of the items usually made using the indirect method, as it results in a smoother and more even surface.",

This is important because, due to the tremendous advancement of the smartphone technology, it can be a powerful medium for speech emotion recognition in the outside laboratory natural environment, which is likely to incorporate background noise in the speech. We capitalize on the current breakthrough of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and seek to investigate its performance for emotion classification from noisy speech. We particularly focus on the recently proposed Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which is yet to be explored for emotion recognition from speech. Experiments conducted with speech compounded with eight different types of noises reveal that GRU incurs an 18.16 smaller run-time while performing quite comparably to the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which is the most popular Recurrent Neural Network proposed to date. This result is promising for any embedded platform in general and will initiate further studies to utilize GRU to its full potential for emotion recognition on smartphones.",

However, these black-box representations are poorly understood, and their mode of transfer remains elusive. In this work, we attempt to understand massively multilingual NMT representations (with 103 languages) using Singular Value Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA), a representation similarity framework that allows us to compare representations across different languages, layers and models. Our analysis validates several empirical results and long-standing intuitions, and unveils new observations regarding how representations evolve in a multilingual translation model. We draw three major conclusions from our analysis, with implications on cross-lingual transfer learning: (i) Encoder representations of different languages cluster based on linguistic similarity, (ii) Representations of a source language learned by the encoder are dependent on the target language, and vice-versa, and (iii) Representations of high resource andor linguistically similar languages are more robust when fine-tuning on an arbitrary language pair, which is critical to determining how much cross-lingual transfer can be expected in a zero or few-shot setting. We further connect our findings with existing empirical observations in multilingual NMT and transfer learning.",

In this paper, new insights are provided in the regulation of tissue homeostasis after intestinal infection. The unexpected lack of an altered pattern of ileal protein production associated to resistance development suggests that this resistance depends on rapid changes, affecting the early establishment of worms, rather than the activation of later effector mechanisms. These results may contribute to the development of new control tools for the management of these parasitic infections.",

Kriging is a zero-bias minimum-variance estimator that performs spatial interpolation based on a weighted average of known observations. Rather than solving for the kriging weights via the traditional method of inverting covariance matrices, we propose a supervised form in which we learn a deep network to generate said weights. We combine the kriging weight generation and kriging process into a joint network that can be learned end-to-end. Our network achieves competitive super-resolution results as other state-of-the-art methods. In addition, since the super-resolution process follows a known statistical framework, we are able to estimate bias and variance, something which is rarely possible for other deep networks.",

The existence of only two stable states in MTJs implies a high overhead of obtaining optimal binary weights in software. We illustrate that the inherent parallelism in the crossbar structure makes it highly appropriate for in-situ training, wherein the network is taught directly on the hardware. It leads to significantly smaller training overhead as the training time is independent of the size of the network, while also circumventing the effects of alternate current paths in the crossbar and accounting for manufacturing variations in the device. We show how the stochastic switching characteristics of MTJs can be leveraged to perform probabilistic weight updates using the gradient descent algorithm. We describe how the update operations can be performed on crossbars both with and without access transistors and perform simulations on them to demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques. The results reveal that stochastically trained MTJ-crossbar NNs achieve a classification accuracy nearly same as that of real-valued-weight networks trained in software and exhibit immunity to device variations.",
